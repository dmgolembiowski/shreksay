00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,840
SHREK
Once upon a time there
was a lovely princess.

2
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,680
SHREK
But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort...

3
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,640
SHREK
which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.

4
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,060
SHREK
She was locked away
in a castle...

5
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,360
SHREK
guarded by a terrible
fire-breathing dragon.

6
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,820
SHREK
Many brave knights had attempted to
free her from this dreadful prison,

7
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,650
SHREK
but none prevailed.

8
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,910
SHREK
She waited in the
dragon's keep...

9
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,910
SHREK
in the highest room of
the tallest tower...

10
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,540
SHREK
for her true love and
true love's first kiss.

11
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,580
SHREK
Like that's ever gonna happen.

12
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,420
SHREK
What a load of...

13
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,090
MUSIC
Somebody once told me the
world is gonna roll me

14
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,140
MUSIC
I am not the sharpest
tool in the shed.

15
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,140
MUSIC
She was looking kind of dumb
with her finger and her thumb.

16
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,940
MUSIC
In the shape of an
I on her forehead.

17
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,940
MUSIC
The years start coming and
they don't stop coming.

18
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,860
MUSIC
Fed to the rules and I
hit the ground running.

19
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,200
MUSIC
Didn't make sense not
to live for fun.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,490
MUSIC
Your brain gets smart but
your head gets dumb.

21
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,490
MUSIC
So much to do So much to see.

22
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,160
MUSIC
So what's wrong with
taking the backstreets.

23
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,290
MUSIC
You'll never know
if you don't go.

24
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,830
MUSIC
You'll never shine
if you don't glow.

29
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,850
MUSIC
Only shooting stars
break the mould.

30
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,940
MUSIC
It's a cool place and
they say it gets colder.

31
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,190
MUSIC
You're bundled up now but
wait till you get older.

32
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,400
MUSIC
But the meteor men
beg to differ.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
MUSIC
Judging by the hole in
the satellite picture.

34
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,200
MUSIC
The ice we skate is
getting pretty thin.

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,319

The water's getting warm
so you might as well swim.

My world's on fire
How about yours.

Think it's in there?
All right. Let's get it!

51
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,720
MEN
Whoa. Hold on. Do you know
what that thing can do to you?

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,760
MEN
Yeah, it'll grind your
bones for its bread.

SHREK
Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,940
SHREK
Now, ogres...
They're much worse.

55
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,940
SHREK
They'll make a suit from
your freshly peeled skin.

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,110
MEN
No!
SHREK
They'll shave your liver.

SHREK
Squeeze the jelly
from your eyes!

SHREK
Actually, it's quite good on toast.

Right.

SHREK
And stay out!

63

All right. This one's full.

Get up! Come on!
Twenty pieces.

GUARD
Keep quiet!

72
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,860
LITTLE BEAR
This cage is too small.

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,060
DONKEY
Please don't turn me in. I'll
never be stubborn again.

I can change. Please!
Give me another chance!

Oh, shut up. Oh!

GUARD
What have you got?
GIPETTO
This little wooden puppet.

77
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,540
PINOCCHIO
I'm not a puppet.
I'm a real boy.

78
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,000
GUARD
Five shillings for
the possessed toy.

79
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,170
GUARD
Take it away.
PINOCCHIO
Father, please! Don't let them do this!

80
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,170
PINOCCHIO
Help me!
GUARD
Next. What have you got?

81
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,880
OLD WOMAN
Well, I've got a talking donkey.

82
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,510
GUARD
Right. Well, that's good for ten
shillings, if you can prove it.

83
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,510
OLD WOMAN
Oh, go ahead, little fella.

84
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,520
GUARD
Well?

85
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,310
OLD WOMAN
Oh, oh, he's just... He's
just a little nervous.

86
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,360
OLD WOMAN
He's really quite a chatterbox.
Talk, you bone headed dolt...

87
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,030
GUARD
That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
OLD WOMAN
No, no, he talks!

88
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,240
OLD WOMAN
He does. I can talk.
I love to talk.

89
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,240
OLD WOMAN
I'm the talkingest damn
thing you ever saw.

90
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,870
GUARD
Get her out of my sight.
OLD WOMAN
No, no!

91
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,370
OLD WOMAN
I swear! Oh! He can talk!

92
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,090
DONKEY
Hey! I can fly!

93
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,800
PETER PAN
He can fly!
3 LITTLE PIGS
He can fly!

94
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,930
GUARD
He can talk!
DONKEY
Ha, ha! That's right, fool!

95
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,260
Now I'm a flying,
talking donkey.

96
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,970
DONKEY
You might have seen a house
fly, maybe even a super fly,

97
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,100
DONKEY
but I bet you are not
never seen a donkey fly.

98
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,100
DONKEY
Ha, ha!

99
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,100
DONKEY
Uh-oh.

100
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,440
GUARD
Seize him!

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,240
GUARD
After him! He's getting away!

102
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,290
GUARD
Get him! This way! Turn!

103
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,800
GUARD
You there. Ogre!

104
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,180
SHREK
Aye?

105
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,293
GUARD
By the order of
Lord Farquaad, I am

106
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,350
GUARD
authorised to place you
both under arrest...

107
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,020
GUARD
and transport you to a designated...
resettlement facility.

108
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,150
SHREK
Oh, really? You and what army?

109
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,910
DONKEY
Can I say something to you?

110
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,330
DONKEY
Listen, you was really, really
something back there. Incredible!

111
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,170
SHREK
Are you talking to...
me? Whoa!

112
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,223
DONKEY
Yes, I was talking to you.
Can I tell you

113
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:50,220
DONKEY
that you was great back there?
Those guards!

114
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,010
DONKEY
They thought they was all of that.
Then you showed up, and bam!

115
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,050
DONKEY
They was tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

116
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,060
DONKEY
That really made me
feel good to see that.

117
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,180
SHREK
Oh, that's great. Really.
DONKEY
Man, it's good to be free.

118
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,810
DONKEY
Now, why don't you go celebrate your
freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

119
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,190
DONKEY
But, uh, I don't
have any friends.

120
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,950
DONKEY
And I'm not going out
there by myself.

121
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,570
DONKEY
Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea!
I'll stick with you.

122
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,580
DONKEY
You're a mean, green,
fighting machine.

123
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,060
DONKEY
Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.

124
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,920
DONKEY
Oh, wow! That was
really scary.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,843
DONKEY
If you don't mind me saying,
if that don't work,

126
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:29,710
DONKEY
your breath certainly
will get the job done,

127
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,009
DONKEY
'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs
or something, 'cause your breath stinks!

128
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,220
DONKEY
You almost burned the
hair outta my nose,

129
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,140
DONKEY
just like the time...

130
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,940
DONKEY
Then I ate some rotten berries. I had
strong gases eking out of my butt that day.

131
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,730
SHREK
Why are you following me?

132
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,400
DONKEY
I'll tell you why.

133
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,400
DONKEY
'Cause I'm all alone.

134
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,240
DONKEY
There's no one here beside me.

135
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,990
DONKEY
My problems have all gone.

136
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,410
DONKEY
There's no one to deride me.

137
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,460
DONKEY
But you gotta have friends...

138
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,590
SHREK
Stop singing!

139
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,710
SHREK
It's no wonder you don't
have any friends.

140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,420
DONKEY
Wow. Only a true friend
would be that truly honest.

141
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,600
SHREK
Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me.
What am I?

142
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,600
DONKEY
Uh...

143
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,730
DONKEY
Really tall?
SHREK
No! I'm an ogre.

144
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,020
SHREK
You know. Grab your
torch and pitchforks.

145
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,110
SHREK
Doesn't that bother you?

146
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,320
DONKEY
Nope.

147
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,280
SHREK
Really?
DONKEY
Really, really.

148
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,490
SHREK
Oh.
DONKEY
Man, I like you. What's your name?

149
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,250
SHREK
Uh, Shrek.

150
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,580
DONKEY
Shrek? Well, you know what
I like about you, Shrek?

151
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,678
DONKEY
You got that kind of.

152
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:51,710
DONKEY
I-don't-care-what-nobody... thinks-of-me
thing.

153
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,590
DONKEY
I like that. I respect that, Shrek.
You all right.

154
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,680
DONKEY
Wooh! Look at that. Who'd want
to live in a place like that?

155
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,970
SHREK
That would be my home.

156
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,930
DONKEY
Oh! And it is lovely!
Just beautiful.

157
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,810
DONKEY
You are quite a decorator. It's amazing
what you've done with such a modest budget.

158
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,650
DONKEY
I like that Boulder.
That is a nice Boulder.

159
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,120
DONKEY
I guess you don't
entertain much, do you?

160
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,990
SHREK
I like my privacy.

161
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,660
DONKEY
You know, I do too. That's
another thing we have in common.

162
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,000
DONKEY
Like, I hate it when you
got somebody in your face.

163
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,028
DONKEY
You're trying to give them a
hint, and they won't leave.

164
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,000
DONKEY
There's that awkward silence.

165
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,840
DONKEY
Can I stay with you?
SHREK
Uh, what?

166
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,510
DONKEY
Can I stay with you, please?

167
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,890
SHREK
Of course!
DONKEY

168
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,350
SHREK
No.
DONKEY
Please! I don't wanna go back there!

169
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,350
DONKEY
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

170
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,020
DONKEY
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay!

171
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,230
DONKEY
Please! Please!

174
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,320

swapping manly stories,

175
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,200
DONKEY
and in the morning
I'm making waffles.

180
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,170

What kind of quest?

396
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,950

Let me get this straight.
You're gonna go fight a dragon...

DONKEY
and rescue a princess just so Farquaad

400
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:32,300
SHREK
Maybe there's a good reason
donkeys shouldn't talk.

401
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,920
DONKEY
I don't get it. Why don't you just
pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

402
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,930
DONKEY
Throttle him, lay siege
to his fortress,

grind his bones to make your
bread, the whole ogre trip.

Oh, I know what.

405
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,140
SHREK
Maybe I could have decapitated
an entire village...

406
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,350
SHREK
and put their heads on a pike,

407
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,060
SHREK
gotten a knife, cut open their
spleen and drink their fluids.

408
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,280
SHREK
Does that sound good to you?

409
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,990
DONKEY
Uh, no, not really, no.

410

more to ogres than people think.

Example?
SHREK
Example?

Okay, um, ogres are like onions.

SHREK
Yes... No!

They make you cry?
SHREK
No!

You leave them out in the sun, they get all
brown, start sprouting little white hairs.

415
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
SHREK
No! Layers!

416
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,300

Onions have layers.

Ogres have layers!
Onions have layers.

00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,150
DONKEY
You know, not everybody likes onions.

421
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,860
DONKEY
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

422
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,860
SHREK
I don't care... what
everyone likes.

423
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,660
SHREK
Ogres are not like cakes.

424
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,870
DONKEY
You know what else everybody likes?
Parfaits.

425
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,880
DONKEY
Have you ever met a person, you
say, Let's get some parfait,

426
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,880
DONKEY
they say, No, I don't
like no parfait?

427
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,710
DONKEY
Parfaits are delicious.
SHREK
No!

428
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,550
SHREK
You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

429
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,550
SHREK
Ogres are like onions!
End of story.

430
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,600
SHREK
Bye-bye. See ya later.

431
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,860
DONKEY
Parfaits may be the most delicious
thing on the whole damn planet.

432
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,150
SHREK
You know, I think I
preferred your humming.

433
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,900
DONKEY
Do you have a tissue or something?
I'm making a mess.

434
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,900
DONKEY
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

435
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:31,210
MUSIC
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today.

436
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,790
MUSIC
Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh

437
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,340
MUSIC
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today.

438
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,880
MUSIC
Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh.

439
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,890
MUSIC
And everything that you
receive up yonder.

440
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,890
MUSIC
Is what you give to
me the day I wander

441
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,940
MUSIC
I'm on my way

442
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,940
MUSIC
I'm on my way

443
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,110
MUSIC
I'm on my way.

444
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,650
DONKEY
Ooh! Shrek! Did you do that?

445
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,530
DONKEY
You gotta warn somebody before you
just crack one off. My mouth was open.

446
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,330
SHREK
Believe me, Donkey, if it
was me, you'd be dead.

447
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,170
SHREK
It's brimstone.

448
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,420
SHREK
We must be getting close.
DONKEY
Yeah, right, brimstone.

449
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,533
DONKEY
Don't be talking about
it's the brimstone. I

450
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:20,590
DONKEY
know what I smell. It
wasn't no brimstone.

451
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,630
DONKEY
It didn't come off
no stone neither.

452
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,990
SHREK
Sure, it's big enough, but
look at the location.

453
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,830
DONKEY
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when
you said ogres have layers?

454
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,830
SHREK
Oh, aye.

455
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,500
DONKEY
Well, I have a bit of
a confession to make.

456
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,960
DONKEY
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our
fear right out there on our sleeves.

457
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,078
SHREK
Wait a second. Donkeys
don't have sleeves.

458
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:05,130
DONKEY
You know what I mean.

459
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,890
SHREK
You can't tell me you're
afraid of heights.

460
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,253
DONKEY
I'm just a little
uncomfortable about being on

461
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,560
DONKEY
a rickety bridge over a
boiling lake of lava!

462
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,690
SHREK
Come on, Donkey. I'm right
here beside ya, okay?

463
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,440
SHREK
For emotional support,

464
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,070
SHREK
we'll just tackle this thing together
one little baby step at a time.

465
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,070
DONKEY
Really?
SHREK
Really, really.

466
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,370
DONKEY
Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
SHREK
Just keep moving.

467
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,040
SHREK
And don't look down.
DONKEY
Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

468
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,500
DONKEY
Don't look down. Keep on moving.
Don't look down.

469
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,380
DONKEY
Shrek! I'm looking down!

470
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,380
DONKEY
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off, please!

471
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,010
SHREK
But you're already halfway.
DONKEY
But I know that half is safe!

472
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,890
SHREK
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.
You go back.

473
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,390
DONKEY
Shrek, no! Wait!
SHREK
Just, Donkey...

474
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,560
SHREK
Let's have a dance then, shall we?
DONKEY
Don't do that!

475
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,520
SHREK
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

476
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,690
SHREK
Oh, this?
DONKEY
Yes, that!

477
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,200
SHREK
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

478
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,570
DONKEY
No, Shrek!

479
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,780
DONKEY
No! Stop it!
SHREK
You said do it! I'm doing it.

480
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,120
DONKEY
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

481
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,710
DONKEY
Oh!

482
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,800
SHREK
That'll do, Donkey.
That'll do.

483
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,430
DONKEY
Cool.

484
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,260
DONKEY
So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

485
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,100
SHREK
Inside, waiting for
us to rescue her.

486
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,100
DONKEY
I was talking about the dragon, Shrek.

487
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,500
SHREK
You afraid?

488
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,870
DONKEY
No, but...
SHREK
Shh.

489
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,500
DONKEY
Oh, good. Me neither.

490
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,960
DONKEY
'Cause there's nothing
wrong with being afraid.

491
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,300
DONKEY
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

492
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,430
DONKEY
Unfamiliar dangerous
situation, I might add.

493
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,219
DONKEY
With a dragon that breathes fire and
eats knights and breathes fire,

494
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,680
DONKEY
it sure doesn't mean you're a
coward if you're a little scared.

495
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,770
DONKEY
I sure as heck am not a coward. I know that.

496
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,190
SHREK
Donkey, two things, okay?

497
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,820
SHREK
Shut... up.

498
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,660
DONKEY
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

499
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,370
DONKEY
Stairs? I thought we was
looking for the princess.

500
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,330
SHREK
The princess will be up the stairs in
the highest room in the tallest tower.

501
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,000
DONKEY
What makes you think she'll be there?
SHREK
I read it in a book once.

502
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,000
DONKEY
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

503
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,130
DONKEY
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt too.

504
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,180
DONKEY
Those stairs won't know
which way they're going.

505
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,640
DONKEY
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

506
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,520
DONKEY
Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess with me.
I'm the stair master.

507
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,190
DONKEY
I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a
step right here. I'd step all over it.

508
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,700
SHREK
Well, at least we know where the
princess is, but where's the...

509
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,030
DONKEY
Dragon!

510
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,880
SHREK
Donkey, look out!

511
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
SHREK
Got ya!

512
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:55,030
SHREK
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

513
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,630
DONKEY
Oh! Aah! Aah!

514
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,730
DONKEY
No. Oh, no. No!

515
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,440
DONKEY
Oh, what large teeth you have.

516
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,428
DONKEY
I mean, white, sparkling teeth.
I know you

517
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:33,360
DONKEY
probably hear this all
the time from your food,

518
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,570
DONKEY
but you must bleach, 'cause that is
one dazzling smile you got there.

519
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,160
DONKEY
Do I detect a hint
of minty freshness?

520
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,000
DONKEY
And you know what else? You're...
You're a girl dragon!

521
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,590
DONKEY
Oh, sure! I mean, of course
you're a girl dragon.

522
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,460
DONKEY
You're just reeking
of feminine beauty.

523
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,880
DONKEY
What's the matter with you? You
got something in your eye?

524
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,800
DONKEY
Ooh. Oh. Oh.

525
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,389
DONKEY
Man, I'd really love to stay, but,
you know, I'm, uh...

526
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,350
DONKEY
I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd
work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings.

527
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,350
DONKEY
Shrek!

528
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,150
DONKEY
No! Shrek! Shrek!

529
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,150
DONKEY
Shrek!

530
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,850
FIONA
Oh! Oh!

531
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,850
SHREK
Wake up!
FIONA
What?

532
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,560
SHREK
Are you Princess Fiona?

533
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,980
FIONA
I am, awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

534
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,070
SHREK
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

535
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,150
FIONA   
But wait, Sir Knight.

536
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,530
FIONA
This be-ith our first meeting.

537
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,330
FIONA
Should it not be a
wonderful, romantic moment?

538
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,750
SHREK
Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
FIONA
Hey, wait. What are you doing?

539
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,920
FIONA
You should sweep
me off my feet...

540
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,380
FIONA
out yonder window and down a
rope on to your Valiant steed.

541
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,260
SHREK
You've had a lot of time
to plan this, haven't you?

542
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,590
FIONA
Mm-hmm.

543
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,560
FIONA
But we have to
savour this moment!

544
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,390
FIONA
You could recite an
epic poem for me.

545
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,940
FIONA
A ballad? A sonnet!

546
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,270
FIONA
A Limerick? Or something!
SHREK
I don't think so.

547
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,780
FIONA
Can I at least know the
name of my champion?

548
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,780
SHREK
Um, Shrek.

549
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,580
FIONA
Sir Shrek.

550
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,410
FIONA
I pray that you take this favour
as a token of my gratitude.

551
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,540
SHREK
Thanks!

552
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,380
FIONA
You didn't slay the dragon?

553
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,920
SHREK
It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

554
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,590
FIONA
But this isn't right!

555
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,930
FIONA
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

556
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,100
FIONA
That's what all the
other knights did.

557
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,480
SHREK
Yeah, right before
they burst into flame.

558
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,100
FIONA
That's not the point. Oh!

559
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,650
FIONA
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

560
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,780
SHREK
Well, I have to save my ass.

561
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,070
FIONA
What kind of knight are you?

562
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,570
SHREK
One of a kind.

563
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,030
DONKEY
Slowdown. Slowdown, baby, please.

564
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,330
DONKEY
I believe it's healthy to get to know
someone over a long period of time.

565
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,000
DONKEY
Just call me old-fashioned.

566
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,590
DONKEY
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

567
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,130
DONKEY
I'm not emotionally ready for
a commitment of, uh, this...

568
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,510
DONKEY
Magnitude really is the
word I'm looking for.

569
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,100
DONKEY
Magnitude... Hey, that is
unwanted physical contact.

570
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,640
DONKEY
Hey, what are you doing?

571
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,980
DONKEY
Okay, okay. Let's just backup a little
and take this one step at a time.

572
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:57,190
DONKEY
We really should get to know each
other first as friends or pen pals.

573
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:01,490
DONKEY
I'm on the road a lot, but I
just love receiving cards...

574
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,990
DONKEY
I'd really love
to stay, but...

575
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,660
DONKEY
Don't do that! That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

576
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,438
DONKEY
You're gonna tear it off. I
don't give permission...

577
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:10,160
DONKEY
What are you gonna do with that?

578
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,040
DONKEY
Hey, now. No way. No! No!

579
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,880
DONKEY
No, no! No. No, no, no!
No! Oh!

580
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,700
DONKEY
Hi, Princess!
FIONA
It talks!

581
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,530
SHREK
Yeah, it's getting him to
shut up that's the trick.

582
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,420
SHREK
Oh!

583
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,030
SHREK
Okay, you two,
head for the exit!

584
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,700
SHREK
I'll take care of the dragon.

585
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,710
SHREK
Run!

586
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:28,970
FIONA
You did it!

587
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,930
FIONA
You rescued me! You're amazing.
You're...

588
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,760
FIONA
You're wonderful. You're...

589
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,140
FIONA
a little unorthodox I'll admit.

590
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:43,150
FIONA
But thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

591
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,030
FIONA
I am eternally in your debt.

592
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:51,450
FIONA
And where would a brave knight
be without his noble steed?

593
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,853
DONKEY
I hope you heard that. She
called me a noble steed.

594
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:56,200
DONKEY
She think I'm a steed.

595
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,450
FIONA
The battle is won.

596
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,040
FIONA
You may remove your
helmet, good Sir Knight.

597
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,710
SHREK
Uh, no.
FIONA
Why not?

598
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,000
SHREK
I have helmet hair.

599
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,300
FIONA
Please. I would'st look upon
the face of my rescuer.

600
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,970
SHREK
No, no, you wouldn't... 'St.

601
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,510
FIONA
But how will you kiss me?

602
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,350
SHREK
What? That wasn't in
the job description.

603
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,810
DONKEY
Maybe it's a perk.

604
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:26,320
FIONA
No, it's destiny. Oh, you
must know how it goes.

605
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,190
FIONA
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon...

606
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,200
FIONA
is rescued by a brave knight,

607
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,580
FIONA
and then they share
true love's first kiss.

608
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,740
DONKEY
Hmm? With Shrek? You think...
Wait.

609
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,000
DONKEY
Wait. You think that
Shrek is your true love?

610
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
FIONA
Well, yes.

611
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,590
DONKEY
You think Shrek is
your true love!

612
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,590
FIONA
What is so funny?

613
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,760
SHREK
Let's just say I'm
not your type, okay?

614
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,350
FIONA
Of course, you are.
You're my rescuer.

615
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,890
FIONA
Now... Now remove your helmet.

616
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,190
SHREK
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

617
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,270
FIONA
Just take off the helmet.
SHREK
I'm not going to.

618
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,520
FIONA
Take it off.
SHREK
No!

619
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,690
FIONA
Now!
SHREK
Okay!

620
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,280
SHREK
Easy. As you command,
Your Highness.

621
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,750
FIONA
You... You're a... an ogre.

622
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,760
SHREK
Oh, you were expecting
Prince Charming.

623
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,340
FIONA
Well, yes, actually.

624
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,510
FIONA
Oh, no. This is all wrong.

625
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,890
FIONA
You're not supposed
to be an ogre.

626
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:47,230
SHREK
Princess, I was sent to
rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

627
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,230
SHREK
He's the one who
wants to marry you.

628
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,230
FIONA
Then why didn't he
come rescue me?

629
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,650
SHREK
Good question. You should ask
him that when we get there.

630
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,780
FIONA
But I have to be rescued
by my true love,

631
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,620
FIONA
not by some ogre and his...
his pet.

632
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,750
DONKEY
So much for noble steed.

633
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,460
SHREK
You're not making
my job any easier.

634
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,920
FIONA
I'm sorry, but your job
is not my problem.

635
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,260
FIONA
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if
he wants to rescue me properly,

636
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,680
FIONA
I'll be waiting for
him right here.

637
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,810
SHREK
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right?
I'm a delivery boy.

638
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,140
FIONA
You wouldn't dare.

639
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,230
FIONA
Put me down!
SHREK
Ya coming, Donkey?

640
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,270
DONKEY
I'm right behind ya.

641
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,940
FIONA
Put me down, or you will
suffer the consequences!

642
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:37,530
FIONA
This is not dignified! Put me down!

643
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,490
DONKEY
Okay, so here's
another question.

644
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:43,620
DONKEY
Say there's a woman that digs you, right,
but you don't really like her that way.

645
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,159
DONKEY
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

646
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,670
DONKEY
but you don't get burned
to a crisp and eaten?

647
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,500
FIONA
You just tell her she's
not your true love.

648
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,300
FIONA
Everyone knowest what happens
when you find your...

649
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,970
FIONA
Hey!

650
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,340
FIONA
The sooner we get to
DuLoc the better.

651
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,350
DONKEY
You're gonna love it there, Princess.
It's beautiful!

652
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,180
FIONA
And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?
What's he like?

653
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,390
SHREK
Let me put it this
way, Princess.

654
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,480
SHREK
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

655
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,650
DONKEY
I don't know. There are those
who think little of him.

656
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,660
FIONA
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

657
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,710
FIONA
You're just jealous you can never measure
up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

658
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,710
SHREK
Yeah, well, maybe
you're right, Princess.

659
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:35,090
SHREK
But I'll let you do the measuring
when you see him tomorrow.

660
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,380
FIONA
Tomorrow? It'll take that long?

661
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:44,180
FIONA
Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
SHREK
No, that'll take longer.

662
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,680
SHREK
We can keep going.
FIONA
But there's robbers in the woods.

663
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,100
DONKEY
Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping
is starting to sound good.

664
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,280
SHREK
Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything
we're going to see in this forest.

665
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,740
FIONA
I need to find
somewhere to camp now!

666
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,710
SHREK
Hey! Over here.
DONKEY
Shrek, we can do better than that.

667
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,370
DONKEY
I don't think this is
fit for a princess.

668
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,250
FIONA
No, no, it's perfect. It just
needs a few homey touches.

669
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,260
SHREK
Homey touches? Like what?

670
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,600
FIONA
A door? Well, gentlemen,
I bid thee good night.

671
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,060
DONKEY
You want me to read you a
bedtime story? I will.

672
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,470
FIONA
I said good night!

673
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,900
DONKEY
Shrek, what are you doing?

674
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,020
SHREK
I just... You know... Oh, come on.

675
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,740
SHREK
I was just kidding.

676
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,620
SHREK
And, uh, that one,
that's Throwback,

677
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,120
SHREK
the only ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

678
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:55,290
DONKEY
Right. Yeah.

679
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,300
DONKEY
Hey, can you tell my
future from these stars?

680
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,970
SHREK
The stars don't tell the future, Donkey.
They tell stories.

681
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,640
SHREK
Look there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent.

682
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,350
SHREK
You can guess what he's famous for.
DONKEY
I know you're making this up.

683
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,140
SHREK
No, look. There he is,

684
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,310
SHREK
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stench.

685
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,980
DONKEY
That is nothing but a
bunch of little dots.

686
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,990
SHREK
Sometimes things are
more than they appear.

687
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,240
DONKEY
Hmm?

688
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,370
SHREK
Forget it.

689
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,960
DONKEY
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do
when we get our swamp anyway?

690
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,830
SHREK
Our swamp?

691
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,000
DONKEY
You know, when we're through
rescuing the princess.

692
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,840
SHREK
We? Donkey, there's no we.
There's no our.

693
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,170
SHREK
There's just me and my swamp.

694
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,510
SHREK
The first thing I'm gonna do is build
a ten-foot wall around my land.

695
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,100
DONKEY
You cut me deep, Shrek.

696
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,520
DONKEY
You cut me real deep just now.

697
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,520
SHREK
You know what I think?

698
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,730
SHREK
I think this whole wall thing is
just a way to keep somebody out.

699
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,990
SHREK
No, do ya think?
DONKEY
Are you hiding something?

700
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,030
SHREK
Never mind, Donkey.

701
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:09,530
DONKEY
Oh, this is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

702
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,200
SHREK
No, this is one of those drop-it
and leave-it-alone things.

703
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:17,040
DONKEY
Why don't you want to talk about it?
SHREK
Why do you want to?

704
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,920
DONKEY
Why are you blocking?
SHREK
I'm not blocking.

705
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,250
DONKEY
Oh, yes, you are.
SHREK
Donkey, I'm warning you.

706
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,840
DONKEY
Who you trying to keep out?
SHREK
Everyone! Okay?

707
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,550
DONKEY
Oh, now we're getting somewhere.

708
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,930
SHREK
Oh! For the love of Pete!

709
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,430
DONKEY
What's your problem? What you
got against the whole world?

710
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,730
SHREK
I'm not the one with
the problem, okay?

711
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,770
SHREK
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

712
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,730
SHREK
People take one look at me and go, Aah!
Help! Run!

713
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,570
SHREK
A big, stupid, ugly ogre!

714
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,870
SHREK
They judge me
before they even know me.

715
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,870
SHREK
That's why I'm
better off alone.

716
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,000
DONKEY
You know what?

717
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:09,760
DONKEY
When we met, I didn't think you was
just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

718
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,760
SHREK
Yeah, I know.

719
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,270
DONKEY
So, uh, are there any
donkeys up there?

720
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,730
SHREK
Well, there's, um, Gabby,

721
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,110
SHREK
the Small and Annoying.

722
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:27,110
DONKEY
Okay, I see it now. The big shiny
one, right there. That one there?

723
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,360
SHREK
That's the moon.
DONKEY
Oh, okay.

724
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,140
FARQUAAD
Again. Show me again.

725
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,690
FARQUAAD
Mirror, mirror, show her to me.
Show me the princess.

726
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:06,820
MIRROR
Hmph.

727
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,700
FARQUAAD
Ah. Perfect.

728
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,890
FARQUAAD
Mmm, yeah, you know I
like it like that.

729
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:22,230
DONKEY
Come on, baby. I said I like it.
SHREK
Donkey, wake up.

730
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,850
DONKEY
Huh? What?
SHREK
Wake up.

731
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,900
DONKEY
What?
SHREK
Good morning.

732
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,230
FIONA
How do you like your eggs?

733
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,280
DONKEY
Good morning, Princess!
SHREK
What's all this about?

734
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,330
FIONA
We kind of got off to a
bad start yesterday.

735
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,410
FIONA
I wanted to make it up to you.

736
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:45,040
FIONA
After all, you did rescue me.

737
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,130
SHREK
Uh, thanks.

738
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,010
FIONA
Well, eat up. We've got
a big day ahead of us.

739
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,430
DONKEY
Shrek!

740
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,390
SHREK
What? It's a compliment.

741
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,430
SHREK
Better out than in, I always say.

742
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,270
DONKEY
Well, it's no way to behave in
front of a princess.

743
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,980
FIONA
Thanks.
DONKEY
She's as nasty as you are.

744
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,900
SHREK
You know, you're not
exactly what I expected.

745
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:20,080
FIONA
Maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

746
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,160
ROBIN HOOD
La Liberte! Hey!

747
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,170
SHREK
Princess!

748
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,920
FIONA
What are you doing?

749
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,920
ROBIN HOOD
Be still, Mon Cherie,
for I am your saviour!

750
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:37,470
ROBIN HOOD
And I am rescuing you from this green...

751
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,100
ROBIN HOOD
Beast.
SHREK
Hey!

752
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,510
SHREK
That's my princess!
Go find your own!

753
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:47,640
ROBIN HOOD
Please, monster! Can't you
see I'm a little busy here?

754
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,320
FIONA
Look, pal, I don't know
who you think you are!

755
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,980
ROBIN HOOD
Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude.

756
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,150
ROBIN HOOD
Please let me
introduce myself.

757
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,110
ROBIN HOOD
Oh, Merry Men!

758
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,200
MERRY MEN
Ta, dah, dah, dah, wooh

759
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,370
ROBIN HOOD
I steal from the rich
and give to the needy.

760
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,580
MERRY MEN
He takes a wee percentage.
ROBIN HOOD
But I'm not greedy

761
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,670
ROBIN HOOD
I rescue pretty damsels
Man, I'm good.

762
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,710
MERRY MEN
What a guy, Monsieur Hood.
ROBIN HOOD
Break it down.

763
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,680
ROBIN HOOD
I like an honest fight
and a saucy little maid.

764
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,041
MERRY MEN
What he's basically saying
is he likes to get... 
ROBIN HOOD
Paid.

765
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,680
ROBIN HOOD
So. When an ogre in the
bush grabs a lady by the tush.

766
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,060
ROBIN HOOD
That's bad.
MERRY MEN
That's bad.

767
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,400
ROBIN HOOD
When a beauty's with a beast
it makes me awfully mad.

768
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,400
MERRY MEN
He's mad He's
really, really mad

769
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,439
ROBIN HOOD
I'll take my blade and ram
it through your heart.

770
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,030
ROBIN HOOD
Keep your eyes on me, boys
'cause I'm about to start.

771
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,250
FIONA
Man, that was annoying!

772
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,080
MERRY MEN
Oh, you little...

773
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,400
FIONA
Um, shall we?

774
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,620
SHREK
Hold the phone.

775
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,160
SHREK
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now.

776
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,250
SHREK
Where did that come from?
FIONA
What?

777
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,210
SHREK
That! Back there.
That was amazing!

778
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,210
SHREK
Where did you learn that?

779
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,420
FIONA
Well... When one lives alone,

780
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,260
FIONA
uh, one has to learn these
things in case there's a...

781
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,970
FIONA
There's an arrow in your butt!
SHREK
What?

782
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,850
SHREK
Oh, would you look at that?
FIONA
Oh, no. This is all my fault.

783
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,850
FIONA
I'm so sorry.
DONKEY
Why? What's wrong?

784
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,588
FIONA
Shrek's hurt.

785
00:53:50,601 --> 00:53:52,270
FIONA
Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt?
Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

786
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,238
SHREK
Donkey, I'm okay.

787
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:56,150
DONKEY
You can't do this to me. I'm
too young for you to die.

788
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,360
DONKEY
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head and cough.

789
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,450
DONKEY
Does anyone know the Heimlich?
SHREK
Donkey! Calm down.

790
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,833
FIONA
If you want to help
Shrek, run into the woods

791
00:54:03,846 --> 00:54:06,160
FIONA
and find me a blue
flower with red thorns.

792
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,830
DONKEY
Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it.
Blue flower, red thorns.

793
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:13,370
DONKEY
Don't die, Shrek. If you see a long
tunnel, stay away from the light!

794
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,630
FIONA
Donkey!
SHREK
Donkey!
DONKEY
Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

795
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,000
DONKEY
Blue flower, red thorns.
SHREK
What are the flowers for?

796
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,300
FIONA
For getting rid of Donkey.
SHREK
Ah.

797
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,760
FIONA
Now you hold still, and
I'll yank this thing out.

798
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,050
SHREK
Ow! Hey! Easy
with the yanking.

799
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,760
FIONA
I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
SHREK
No, it's tender.

800
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,600
FIONA
Now, hold on.

801
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,713
SHREK
What you're doing is
the opposite of help.

802
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,770
FIONA
Don't move.

803
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,520
SHREK
Look, time out.
FIONA
Would you...

804
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,070
FIONA
Okay. What do you propose we do?

805
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,493
DONKEY
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

806
00:54:41,506 --> 00:54:42,860
DONKEY
Blue flower, red thorns.

807
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,320
DONKEY
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't colour-blind!

808
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,490
DONKEY
Blue flower, red thorns.
SHREK
Ow!

809
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,990
DONKEY
Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!

810
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,620
SHREK
Ow! Not good.

811
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,250
FIONA
Okay. Okay, I can nearly see the head.

812
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:58,960
FIONA
It's just about...
SHREK
Ow! Ohh!

813
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,420
DONKEY
Ahem.

814
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,890
SHREK
Nothing happened.
We were just, uh...

815
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,680
DONKEY
Look, if you wanted to be alone,
all you had to do was ask.

816
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,020
SHREK
Oh, come on! That's the
last thing on my mind.

817
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,770
SHREK
The princess here was just...
Ugh!

818
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,650
SHREK
Ow!
DONKEY
Hey, what's that?

819
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,570
DONKEY
That's... Is that blood?

820

MUSIC
My beloved monster and me.

821
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,310
MUSIC
We go everywhere together.

822

She will always be
the only thing.

825

MUSIC
That comes between me
and the awful sting.

826
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:15,910
MUSIC
That comes from living in a
world that's so damn mean.

There it is, Princess.

832
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,460
SHREK
Your future awaits you.

833
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,790
FIONA
That's DuLoc?
DONKEY
Yeah, I know.

834
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,550
DONKEY
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something,

835
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,130
DONKEY
which I think means he
has a really... Ow!

836
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,130
SHREK
Um, I, uh...

837
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,640
SHREK
I guess we better move on.
FIONA
Sure.

838
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,810
FIONA
But, Shrek?

839
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,680
FIONA
I'm... I'm worried about Donkey.

840
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:20,140
SHREK
What?
FIONA
I mean, look at him.

841
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:23,230
FIONA
He doesn't look so good.
DONKEY
What are you talking about? I'm fine.

842
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:28,320
FIONA
That's what they always say, and then
next thing you know, you're on your back.

843
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,860
FIONA
Dead.
SHREK
You know, she's right.

844
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:33,820
SHREK
You look awful. Do you
want to sit down?

845
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,620
FIONA
I'll make you some tea.
DONKEY
I didn't want to say nothing,

846
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,450
DONKEY
but I got this twinge in my neck, and
when I turn my head like this, look.

847
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,460
DONKEY
Ow! See?

848
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,140
SHREK
Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
FIONA
I'll get the firewood.

849
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:48,710
DONKEY
Hey, where you going? Oh,
man, I can't feel my toes!

850
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,300
DONKEY
I don't have any toes!

851
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,720
DONKEY
I think I need a hug.

852
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,520
FIONA
Mmm.

853
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,560
FIONA
Mmm. This is good.
This is really good.

854
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:08,030
FIONA
What is this?
SHREK
Uh, Weedrat.

855
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,240
SHREK
Rotisserie style.

856
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,820
FIONA
No kidding.

857
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,820
FIONA
Well, this is delicious.

858
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,990
SHREK
Well, they're also
great in stews.

859
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,330
SHREK
Now, I don't mean to brag, but
I make a mean Weedrat stew.

860
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,170
FIONA
I guess I'll be dining a
little differently tomorrow night.

861
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:34,340
SHREK
Maybe you can come visit
me in the swamp sometime.

862
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,600
SHREK
I'll cook all kinds
of stuff for you.

863
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,560
SHREK
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartar...
you name it.

864
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,770
FIONA
I'd like that.

865
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:53,900
MUSIC
See the pyramids
along the Nile.

866
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,620
SHREK
Um, Princess?

867
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,950
MUSIC
Watch the sun rise from a tropic isle.
FIONA
Yes, Shrek?

868
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,870
SHREK
I, um, I was wondering.
MUSIC
Just remember, darling all the while.

869
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,210
SHREK
Are you...

870
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,880
MUSIC
You belong to me.

871
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,760
SHREK
Are you gonna eat that?

872
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,640
DONKEY
- Man, isn't this romantic? Just
look at that sunset.
FIONA
Sunset?

873
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,270
FIONA
Oh, no! I mean, it's late.

874
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,230
FIONA
I-It's very late.
SHREK
What?

875
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,230
DONKEY
Wait a minute. I see
what's going on here.

876
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,280
DONKEY
You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
FIONA
Yes!

877
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,370
FIONA
Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.
You know, I'd better go inside.

878
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,790
DONKEY
Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to
be afraid of the dark, too, until...

879
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,620
DONKEY
Hey, no, wait. I'm still
afraid of the dark.

880
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,880
FIONA
Good night.

881
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,000
SHREK
Good night.

882
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,130
DONKEY
Ohh!

883
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:56,970
DONKEY
Now I really see
what's going on here.

884
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,970
SHREK
Oh, what are you
talking about?

885
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,810
DONKEY
I don't even wanna hear it. Look,
I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

886
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,310
DONKEY
I know you two were digging on each other.
I could feel it.

887
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:07,230
SHREK
You're crazy. I'm just
bringing her back to Farquaad.

888
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:10,650
DONKEY
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up
and smell the pheromones.

889
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:13,400
DONKEY
Just go on in and tell her how you feel.
SHREK
I...

890
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,490
SHREK
There's nothing to tell. Besides,
even if I did tell her that,

891
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,490
SHREK
well, you know...

892
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:23,080
SHREK
and I'm not saying I
do 'cause I don't...

893
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,580
SHREK
she's a princess, and I'm...

894
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,330
DONKEY
An ogre?

895
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,080
SHREK
Yeah. An ogre.

896
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:35,210
DONKEY
Hey, where you going?
SHREK
To get... more firewood.

897
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,150
DONKEY
Princess?

898
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,950
DONKEY
Princess Fiona?

899
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,040
DONKEY
Princess, where are you?

900
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,790
DONKEY
Princess?

901
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,630
DONKEY
It's very spooky in here. I
am not playing no games.

902
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:32,270
DONKEY
Aah!
FIONA
Oh, no!
DONKEY
No, help!

903
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,440
FIONA
Shh!
DONKEY
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
FIONA
No, it's okay. It's okay.

904
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,400
DONKEY
What did you do with the princess?
FIONA
Donkey, I'm the princess.

905
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,240
DONKEY
Aah!
FIONA
It's me, in this body.

906
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,870
DONKEY
Oh, my God! You
ate the princess!

907
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,870
DONKEY
Can you hear me?
FIONA
Donkey!

908
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,290
DONKEY
Listen, keep breathing! I'll
get you out of there!
FIONA
No!

909
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,830
DONKEY
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
FIONA
Shh.

910
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,750
DONKEY
Shrek!
FIONA
This is me.

911
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,760
DONKEY
Princess?

912
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,340
DONKEY
What happened to you?
You're, uh, uh,

913
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,350
DONKEY
uh, different.

914
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,680
FIONA
I'm ugly, okay?
DONKEY
Well, yeah!

915
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,890
DONKEY
Was it something you ate? 'Cause I
told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

916
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,520
DONKEY
You are what you eat, I said. Now...
FIONA
No.

917
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:17,940
FIONA
I... I've been this way
as long as I can remember.

918
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:20,490
DONKEY
What do you mean? Look, I ain't
never seen you like this before.

919
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,740
FIONA
It only happens when
the sun goes down.

920
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,790
FIONA
By night one way,
by day another.

921
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,910
FIONA
This shall be the norm...

922
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,120
FIONA
until you find true
love's first kiss...

923
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:38,630
FIONA
and then take
love's true form.

924
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:42,260
DONKEY
Ah, that's beautiful. I
didn't know you wrote poetry.

925
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,260
FIONA
It's a spell.

926
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,930
FIONA
When I was a little girl,

927
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,680
FIONA
a witch cast a spell on me.

928
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,310
FIONA
Every night I become this.

929
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:56,060
FIONA
This horrible, ugly beast!

930
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:03,610
FIONA
I was placed in a tower to await the
day my true love would rescue me.

931
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,280
FIONA
That's why I have to marry
Lord Farquaad tomorrow...

932
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:09,790
FIONA
before the sun sets
and he sees me...

933
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,000
FIONA
like this.

934
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,330
DONKEY
All right, all right. Calm down.
Look, it's not that bad.

935
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:21,590
DONKEY
You're not that ugly. Well, I
am not gonna lie. You are ugly.

936
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:24,680
DONKEY
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24-7.

937
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,140
FIONA
But, Donkey, I'm a princess,

938
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:31,810
FIONA
and this is not how a
princess is meant to look.

939
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:35,640
DONKEY
Princess, how about if you
don't marry Farquaad?

940
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,650
FIONA
I have to.

941
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,570
FIONA
Only my true love's kiss
can break the spell.

942
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,190
DONKEY
But, you know, um,
you're kind of an ogre,

943
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,700
DONKEY
and Shrek... well, you
got a lot in common.

944
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,280
FIONA
Shrek?

945
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:53,200
SHREK
Princess, I... Uh, how's
it going, first of all?

946
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:56,080
SHREK
Good? Um, good for me too.

947
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,080
SHREK
I'm okay.

948
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:03,050
SHREK
I saw this flower and thought of
you because it's pretty and...

949
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:07,380
SHREK
well, I don't really like it, but I thought
you might like it 'cause you're pretty.

950
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,680
SHREK
But I like you anyway.
I'd... uh, uh...

951
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:16,390
SHREK
I'm in trouble.
Okay, here we go.

952
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,980
FIONA
I can't just marry whoever I want.

953
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,360
FIONA
Take a good look
at me, Donkey.

954
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,360
FIONA
I mean, really,

955
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,110
FIONA
who could ever love a beast
so hideous and ugly?

956
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,610
FIONA
Princess and ugly
don't go together.

957
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,120
FIONA
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

958
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,620
FIONA
My only chance to live happily ever
after is to marry my true love.

959
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,120
FIONA
Don't you see, Donkey?

960
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:42,500
FIONA
That's just how it has to be.

961
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:45,630
FIONA
It's the only way
to break the spell.

962
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:48,470
DONKEY
You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
FIONA
No!

963
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:51,470
FIONA
You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

964
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,680
DONKEY
What's the point of being able to
talk if you gotta keep secrets?

965
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,890
FIONA
Promise you won't tell.
Promise!

966
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:00,060
DONKEY
All right, all right. I won't tell him.
But you should.

967
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:03,150
DONKEY
I just know before this is over, I'm gonna
need a whole lot of serious therapy.

968
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:06,780
DONKEY
Look at my eye twitching.

969
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:33,220
FIONA
I tell him, I tell him not.

970
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,680
FIONA
I tell him, I tell him not.

971
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,690
FIONA
I tell him.

972
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,850
FIONA
Shrek!

973
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,480
FIONA
Shrek, there's
something I want...

974
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,500
FIONA
Shrek.

975
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,970
FIONA
Are you all right?
SHREK
Perfect!

976
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,010
SHREK
Never been better.

977
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:16,390
FIONA
I... I don't... There's
something I have to tell you.

978
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:19,020
SHREK
You don't have to tell
me anything, Princess.

979
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,190
SHREK
I heard enough last night.
FIONA
You heard what I said?

980
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:23,190
SHREK
Every word.

981
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,440
FIONA
I thought you'd understand.

982
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,440
SHREK
Oh, I understand.

983
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,110
FIONA
Like you said, Who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?

984
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,860
FIONA
But I thought that
wouldn't matter to you.

985
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,700
SHREK
Yeah? Well, it does.

986
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,500
SHREK
Ah, right on time.

987
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,460
SHREK
Princess, I've brought
you a little something.

988
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,550
DONKEY
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

989
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,260
DONKEY
Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

990
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,100
FARQUAAD
Princess Fiona.

991
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,890
SHREK
As promised. Now hand it over.

992
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:05,230
FARQUAAD
Very well, ogre. The deed to your
swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

993
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:09,860
FARQUAAD
Take it and go before
I change my mind.

994
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,780
FARQUAAD
Forgive me, Princess,
for startling you,

995
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,780
FARQUAAD
but you startled me,

996
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,530
FARQUAAD
for I have never seen such
a radiant beauty before.

997
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,620
FARQUAAD
I am Lord Farquaad.

998
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,580
FIONA
Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

999
01:07:27,151 --> 01:07:28,630
FIONA
Forgive me, my Lord, for
I was just saying...

1000
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:34,170
FIONA
a short... farewell.

1001
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:38,890
FARQUAAD
That is so sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

1002
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,890
FARQUAAD
It's not like it has feelings.

1003
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:44,940
FIONA
No, you're right. It doesn't.

1004
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:49,020
FARQUAAD
Princess Fiona, beautiful,
fair, flawless Fiona.

1005
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:52,110
FARQUAAD
I ask your hand in marriage.

1006
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:57,240
FARQUAAD
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

1007
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:05,710
FIONA
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

1008
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,960
FARQUAAD
Excellent! I'll start the
plans, for tomorrow we wed!

1009
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,960
FIONA
No! I mean, uh,

1010
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,420
FIONA
why wait?

1011
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:17,340
FIONA
Let's get married today
before the sun sets.

1012
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:20,140
FARQUAAD
Oh, anxious, are we?
You're right.

1013
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:24,140
FARQUAAD
The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do!

1014
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,560
FARQUAAD
There's the caterer, the cake,
the band, the guest list.

1015
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,650
FARQUAAD
Captain, round up some guests!

1016
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:32,440
FIONA
Fare-thee-well, ogre.

1017
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,110
DONKEY
Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away.

1018
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,539
SHREK
Yeah? So what?

1019
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:37,911
DONKEY
Shrek, there's something
about her you don't know.

1020
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:40,410
DONKEY
Look, I talked to her last night.
She's...

1021
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:44,540
SHREK
I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pals, aren't ya?

1022
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,370
SHREK
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why don't you follow her home?

1023
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,420
DONKEY
Shrek, I... I wanna
go with you.

1024
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,460
SHREK
I told you, didn't I? You're
not coming home with me.

1025
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:57,510
SHREK
I live alone! My swamp!
Me! Nobody else!

1026
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,680
SHREK
Understand? Nobody!

1027
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,600
SHREK
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

1028
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,850
DONKEY
But I thought...
SHREK
Yeah. You know what?

1029
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,150
SHREK
You thought wrong!

1030
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,820
DONKEY
Shrek.

1031
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:23,620
MUSIC
I heard there was
a secret chord.

1032
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,750
MUSIC
That David played and
it pleased the Lord.

1033
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:31,670
MUSIC
But you don't really
care for music, do ya.

1034
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,760
MUSIC
It goes like this the
fourth, the fifth.

1035
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,380
MUSIC
The minor fall the major lift.

1036
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:46,100
MUSIC
The baffled king
composing hallelujah.

1037
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,430
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1038
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,940
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1039
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:56,940
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1040
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:01,780
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1041
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,200
MUSIC
Baby, I've been here before

1042
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,410
MUSIC
I know this room I've
walked this floor

1043
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:15,590
MUSIC
I used to live alone
before I knew you

1044
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,380
MUSIC
I've seen your flag
on the marble arch.

1045
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,800
MUSIC
But love is not a
victory march.

1046
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:28,310
MUSIC
It's a cold and it's
a broken hallelujah.

1047
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:33,060
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1048
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,270
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1049
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,400
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1050
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,160
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1051
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,580
MUSIC
And all I ever
learned from love

1052
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,040
MUSIC
I show to shoot at someone.

1053
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,710
MUSIC
Who outdrew you.

1054
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,510
MUSIC
And it's not a cry you
can hear at night.

1055
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:02,630
MUSIC
It's not somebody
who's seen the light.

1056
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:09,770
MUSIC
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.

1057
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:12,640
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1058
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:15,980
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1059
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:19,320
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1060
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,080
MUSIC
Hallelujah.

1061
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,290
SHREK
Donkey?

1062
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,590
SHREK
What are you doing?

1063
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:41,630
DONKEY
I would think, of all people, you would
recognise a wall when you see one.

1064
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:43,630
SHREK
Well, yeah.

1065
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,090
SHREK
But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.

1066
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,970
DONKEY
It is around your half. See, that's
your half, and this is my half.

1067
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,640
SHREK
Oh! Your half. Hmm.

1068
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,270
DONKEY
Yes, my half. I helped
rescue the princess.

1069
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,600
DONKEY
I did half the work, I
get half the booty.

1070
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:01,020
DONKEY
Now hand me that big old rock, the
one that looks like your head.

1071
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:03,440
SHREK
Back off!
DONKEY
No, you back off.

1072
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:05,530
SHREK
This is my swamp!
DONKEY
Our swamp.

1073
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,530
SHREK
Let go, Donkey!
DONKEY
You let go.

1074
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:09,580
SHREK
Stubborn jackass!
DONKEY
Smelly ogre.

1075
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,870
SHREK
Fine!

1076
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,608
DONKEY
Hey, come back here. I'm
not through with you yet.

1077
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:15,290
SHREK
Well, I'm through with you.

1078
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:18,630
DONKEY
Uh-uh. You know, with you
it's always, Me, me, me!

1079
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,300
DONKEY
Well, guess what!
Now it's my turn!

1080
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,510
DONKEY
So you just shut up
and pay attention!

1081
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,550
DONKEY
You are mean to me.

1082
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:28,140
DONKEY
You insult me and you don't
appreciate anything that I do!

1083
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,310
DONKEY
You're always pushing me
around or pushing me away.

1084
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:35,230
SHREK
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you
so bad, how come you came back?

1085
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:38,520
DONKEY
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

1086
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,820
SHREK
Oh, yeah. You're
right, Donkey.

1087
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:46,110
SHREK
I forgive you... for
stabbing me in the back!

1088
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:51,620
DONKEY
Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion
boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.

1089
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,160
SHREK
Go away!
DONKEY
There you are, doing it
again just like you did to Fiona.

1090
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,830
DONKEY
All she ever do was like
you, maybe even love you.

1091
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,040
SHREK
Love me? She said I was
ugly, a hideous creature.

1092
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:04,050
SHREK
I heard the two
of you talking.

1093
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,050
DONKEY
She wasn't talking about you.

1094
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:08,470
DONKEY
She was talking about,
uh, somebody else.

1095
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:13,430
SHREK
She wasn't talking about me?

1096
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:15,810
SHREK
Well, then who was
she talking about?

1097
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,689
DONKEY
Uh-uh, no way. I am not saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me.

1098
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,980
DONKEY
Right? Right?
SHREK
Donkey!

1099
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,610
DONKEY
No!
SHREK
Okay, look.

1100
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,610
SHREK
I'm sorry, all right?

1101
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,150
SHREK
Hmph.

1102
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:34,120
SHREK
I'm sorry.

1103
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:38,460
SHREK
I guess I am just a
big, stupid, ugly ogre.

1104
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,630
SHREK
Can you forgive me?

1105
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,750
DONKEY
Hey, that's what friends
are for, right?

1106
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,510
SHREK
Right. Friends?

1107
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,510
DONKEY
Friends.

1108
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:53,550
SHREK
So, um,

1109
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,890
SHREK
what did Fiona say about me?

1110
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:59,100
DONKEY
What are you asking me for? Why
don't you just go ask her?

1111
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:02,190
SHREK
The wedding! We'll
never make it in time.

1112
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:05,480
DONKEY
Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where
there's a will, there's a way,

1113
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:07,690
DONKEY
and I have a way.

1114
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,530
SHREK
Donkey?

1115
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,990
DONKEY
I guess it's just my
animal magnetism.

1116
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:20,250
SHREK
Aw, come here, you.

1117
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,718
DONKEY
All right, all right.
Don't get all slobbery.

1118
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:23,130
DONKEY
No one likes a kiss ass.

1119
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,750
DONKEY
All right, hop on
and hold on tight.

1120
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,340
DONKEY
I haven't had a chance to
install the seat belts yet.

1121
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,270
SHREK
Wooh!

1122
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,540
PRIEST
People of DuLoc,

1123
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:06,290
PRIEST
we gather here today...

1124
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,420
PRIEST
to bear witness...

1125
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,420
PRIEST
to the union...
FIONA
Um...

1126
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:12,970
PRIEST
of our new king...
FIONA
Excuse me.

1127
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,720
FIONA
Could we just skip ahead to the I do's?

1128
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,720
FARQUAAD
Go on.

1129
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:26,400
DONKEY
Go ahead, have some fun. If we need
you, I'll whistle. How about that?

1130
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:30,940
DONKEY
Shrek, wait, wait!
Wait a minute!

1131
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:33,700
DONKEY
You wanna do this right, don't you?
SHREK
What are you talking about?

1132
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,700
DONKEY
There's a line you
gotta wait for.

1133
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:38,280
DONKEY
The preacher's gonna say, Speak
now or forever hold your peace.

1134
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:42,120
SHREK
That's when you say, I object!
DONKEY
I don't have time for this!

1135
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,910
DONKEY
Wait. What are you doing?
Listen to me!

1136
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,920
DONKEY
Look, you love this woman, don't you?
SHREK
Yes.

1137
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,290
DONKEY
You wanna hold her?
SHREK
Yes.

1138
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,590
DONKEY
Please her?
SHREK
Yes!

1139
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,300
DONKEY
Then you got to, got to
try a little tenderness.

1140
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,130
DONKEY
The chicks love that romantic crap!
SHREK
All right! Cut it out.

1141
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:58,850
SHREK
When does this guy say the line?
DONKEY
We gotta check it out.

1142
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:02,100
PRIEST
And so, by the power vested in me,

1143
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:05,440
SHREK
What do you see?
DONKEY
The whole town's in there.

1144
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,650
PRIEST
I now pronounce you husband and wife,
DONKEY
They're at the altar.

1145
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,280
PRIEST
King and queen.
DONKEY
Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

1146
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,990
SHREK
Oh, for the love of Pete!

1147
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,280
SHREK
I object!

1148
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,450
FIONA
Shrek?

1149
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:21,450
FARQUAAD
Oh, now what does he want?

1150
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,080
SHREK
Hi, everyone. Having
a good time, are ya?

1151
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:30,380
SHREK
I love DuLoc, first of all.

1152
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,960
SHREK
Very clean.
FIONA
What are you doing here?

1153
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:35,970
FARQUAAD
Really, it's rude enough being
alive when no one wants you,

1154
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:39,390
FARQUAAD
but showing up uninvited to a wedding...
SHREK
Fiona!

1155
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:42,470
SHREK
I need to talk to you.
FIONA
Oh, now you wanna talk?

1156
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,520
FIONA
It's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me...

1157
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,980
SHREK
But you can't marry him.
FIONA
And why not?

1158
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:51,940
SHREK
Because... Because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

1159
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,400
FARQUAAD
Outrageous! Fiona,
don't listen to him.

1160
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,110
SHREK
He's not your true love.
FIONA
And what do you know about true love?

1161
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,570
SHREK
Well, I... Uh...

1162
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:04,040
SHREK
I mean...
FARQUAAD
Oh, this is precious.

1163
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,790
FARQUAAD
The ogre has fallen
in love with the princess!

1164
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:11,130
FARQUAAD
Oh, good Lord.

1165
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,130
FARQUAAD
An ogre and a princess!

1166
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,260
FIONA
Shrek, is this true?

1167
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,220
FARQUAAD
Who cares? It's preposterous!

1168
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:28,940
FARQUAAD
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss
away from our happily ever after.

1169
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,610
FARQUAAD
Now kiss me! Mmmm!

1170
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:39,030
FIONA
By night one way,
by day another.

1171
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:43,700
FIONA
I wanted to show you before.

1172
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:08,810
SHREK
Well, uh,

1173
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,890
SHREK
that explains a lot.

1174
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:14,650
FARQUAAD
Ugh! It's disgusting!

1175
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:16,780
FARQUAAD
Guards! Guards!

1176
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:20,030
FARQUAAD
I order you to get that out
of my sight now! Get them!

1177
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,910
FARQUAAD
Get them both!
SHREK
No, no!

1178
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,853
FARQUAAD
This hocus-pocus alters nothing.

1179
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,740
FARQUAAD
Marriage is binding, and
that makes me king!

1180
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:29,120
FARQUAAD
See? See?
FIONA
No, let go of me! Shrek!

1181
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,910
SHREK
No!
FARQUAAD
Don't just stand there, you morons.

1182
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,540
SHREK
Get out of my way! Fiona!

1183
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,710
SHREK
Arrgh!

1184
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,800
FARQUAAD
I'll make you regret the day we met.
I'll see you drawn and quartered!

1185
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,800
FARQUAAD
You'll beg for death to save you!
FIONA
No! Shrek!

1186
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:48,390
FARQUAAD
And as for you, my wife,
SHREK
Fiona!

1187
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:51,140
FARQUAAD
I'll have you locked back in that
tower for the rest of your days!

1188
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:53,060
FARQUAAD
I am king!

1189
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:56,940
FARQUAAD
I will have order! I will have perfection!
I will have...

1190
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:01,280
FARQUAAD
Aaah!

1191
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,110
FARQUAAD
Aah!
DONKEY
All right. Nobody move.

1192
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,280
DONKEY
I got a dragon here, and
I'm not afraid to use it.

1193
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:08,990
DONKEY
I'm a donkey on the edge!

1194
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,080
DONKEY
Celebrity marriages. They
never last, do they?

1195
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:20,090
DONKEY
Go ahead, Shrek.

1196
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,760
SHREK
Uh, Fiona?

FIONA
Yes, Shrek?

1198
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:31,230
SHREK
I... I love you.

1199
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:33,560
FIONA
Really?

1200
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:37,650
SHREK
Really, really.

1201
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:39,650
FIONA
I love you too.

Aawww!

FIONA
Until you find true love's first kiss...

1204
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:55,330
FIONA
and then take love's true form.

1205
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,820
FIONA
Take love's true form.
Take love's true form.

FIONA
Well, yes.

1210
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:43,550
FIONA
But I don't understand.

1211
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,760
FIONA
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1212
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,720
FIONA
But you are beautiful.

1213

I was hoping this would
be a happy ending.
