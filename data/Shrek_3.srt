1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,695
PRINCE CHARMING
Onward, Chauncey!

2
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:58,429
PRINCE CHARMING
To the highest room
of the tallest tower...

3
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:03,668
PRINCE CHARMING
...where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Charming!

4
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:18,787
GINGERBREAD MAN
This is worse than "Love Letters".
I hate dinner theater!

5
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,688
PINOCCHIO
Me, too.

6
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,019
PRINCE CHARMING
Whoa there, Chauncey!

7
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:28,889
ACTRESS
Hark! The brave Prince Charming
approacheth.

8
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:33,404
PRINCE CHARMING
Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay
the monster that guards you...

9
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,475
PRINCE CHARMING
...then take my place as rightful king.

10
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:38,201
OLD LADY
What did she say?

11
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,380
AUDIENCE
It's Shrek!

12
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,311
AUDIENCE
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

13
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,647
PRINCE CHARMING
Prepare, foul beast...

14
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:54,453
PRINCE CHARMING
...to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

15
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:57,154
WAITER
Happy birthday to thee
Happy birthday to thee

16
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:58,559
PRINCE CHARMING
Do you mind?

17
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:02,061
GINGERBREAD MAN
Do you mind? Boring!

18
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:08,905
PRINCE CHARMING
Prepare, foul beast...

19
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:20,613
PRINCE CHARMING
Someday you'll be sorry.

20
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:22,914
AUDIENCE
We already are!

21
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,344
PRINCE CHARMING
Mommy...

22
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,778
PRINCE CHARMING
You're right. I can't let this happen.

23
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:58,955
PRINCE CHARMING
I can't!

24
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:03,892
PRINCE CHARMING
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away.

25
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,123
PRINCE CHARMING
And I promise you this, Mother...

26
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,196
PRINCE CHARMING
...I will restore dignity to my throne.

27
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:14,898
PRINCE CHARMING
And this time,

28
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,205
PRINCE CHARMING
no one will stand in my way.

29
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:37,823
SHREK
Good morning.

30
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:40,492
FIONA
Good morning.

31
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:43,192
FIONA
Morning breath.

32
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:46,499
SHREK
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

33
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:49,004
DONKEY
Good morning, good morning

34
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:52,076
DONKEY
The sun is shining through

35
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,406
DONKEY
Good morning, good morning
To you

36
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:56,674
DONKEY
And you!
And you!

37
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:02,281
DONKEY
They grow up so fast.

38
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:04,515
SHREK
Not fast enough.

39
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:09,288
PUSS
You'll be filling in
for the King and Queen.

40
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,626
PUSS
Several functions
require your attendance, sir.

41
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:16,064
SHREK
Great! Let's get started.

42
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:19,035
DONKEY
Come on, lazybones. Time to get moving!

43
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:22,136
DONKEY
You need to get a pair ofjammies.

44
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:32,813
SHREK
I got some sleep and I needed it

45
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:35,682
SHREK
Not a lot, just a little bit

46
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:38,916
SHREK
Someone's always
trying to keep me from it

47
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:41,891
SHREK
It's a crying shame

48
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:44,928
SHREK
It's a royal pain in the neck

49
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:46,725
SHREK
I knight thee.

50
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:11,716
DONKEY
If you're filling in for a king,
you should look like one.

51
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,918
DONKEY
Can somebody come in
and work on Shrek?

52
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:18,253
RAUL
I will see what I can do.

53
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:41,113
PUSS
Yeah, wow.

54
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:44,445
FIONA
Is this really necessary?

55
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:46,885
RAUL
Quite necessary, Fiona.

56
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:49,824
SHREK
- I'm Shrek, you twit.

57
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:53,659
PUSS
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

58
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,734
DONKEY
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

59
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:59,326
SHREK
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

60
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:02,407
FIONA
I'm sorry, but can you
just try to grin and bear it?

61
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,567
FIONA
It's just until Dad gets better.

62
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:07,977
FIONA
Shrek?

63
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:10,907
FIONA
You look handsome.

64
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,984
SHREK
Come here, you.

65
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,997
SHREK
My butt is itching up a storm and
I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

66
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,774
SHREK
Hey, you! Come here. What's your name?

67
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:38,274
FIDDLESWORTH
Fiddlesworth, sir.

68
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,503
SHREK
Perfect.

69
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,547
MASTER OF CEREMONIES
Ladies and gentlemen...

70
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:47,847
MASTER OF CEREMONIES
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

71
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:53,954
SHREK
Ahh! You've got it.

72
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:55,617
SHREK
A little to the left.

73
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,058
SHREK
That's it! That's good.

74
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:02,292
SHREK
Oh, yeah! Scratch
that thing! You're on it.

75
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,868
FIONA
Shrek!

76
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:09,900
DONKEY
My eye!

77
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,202
WOMAN
What are you doing?

78
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:18,772
SHREK
Fiona!

79
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:25,119
SHREK & FIONA
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

80
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:31,060
DONKEY
Shrimp! My favorite!

81
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:44,270
SHREK & FIONA
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Calm down.

82
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,347
SHREK
Calm down? Who do you think
we're kidding? I am an ogre.

83
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:53,077
SHREK
I'm not cut out for this, Fiona,
and I never will be.

84
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,521
DONKEY
I think that went well.

85
00:07:58,658 --> 00:07:59,886
SHREK
Donkey!

86
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:01,755
DONKEY
Come on, Shrek!

87
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:05,492
PUSS
Some people just don't
understand boundaries.

88
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:19,370
FIONA
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

89
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:22,811
FIONA
...in our vermin-filled shack
strewn with fungus...

90
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,850
FIONA
...and filled with the rotting stench
of mud and neglect.

91
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,613
SHREK
You had me at "vermin-filled".

92
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:34,290
FIONA
And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter
of little feet on the floor.

93
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:37,490
SHREK
That's right, the swamp rats
will be spawning.

94
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,995
FIONA
Uh, no.

95
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:42,828
FIONA
What I'm thinking of is a little bigger
than a swamp rat.

96
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:43,993
SHREK
Donkey?

97
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:47,799
FIONA
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

98
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,202
FIONA
...they were little ogre feet?

99
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,017
SHREK
Honey, let's be rational about this.

100
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:03,519
SHREK
Have you seen a baby lately?

101
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:06,853
SHREK
They just eat and poop, and they cry...

102
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:10,360
SHREK
...then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

103
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,294
SHREK
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

104
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:17,232
SHREK
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

105
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,965
FIONA
Shrek, don't you ever think
about having a family?

106
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:24,668
SHREK
Right now, you're my family.

107
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,842
SHREK
Somebody better be dying.

108
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:35,015
KING HAROLD
I'm dying.

109
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:38,516
QUEEN
Harold?

110
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,787
KING HAROLD
Don't forget
to pay the gardener, Lillian.

111
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,863
QUEEN
Of course, darling.

112
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,658
KING HAROLD
Fiona.

113
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,325
FIONA
Yes, Daddy?

114
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:53,199
KING HAROLD
I know I made many mistakes with you.

115
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:55,673
FIONA
It's okay.

116
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:57,935
KING HAROLD
But your love for Shrek has...

117
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:00,277
KING HAROLD
...taught me much.

118
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,406
KING HAROLD
My dear boy...

119
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,815
KING HAROLD
...I am proud to call you my son.

120
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:11,081
SHREK
And I'm proud to call you my frog...

121
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:13,657
SHREK
...King dad-in-law.

122
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:19,390
KING HAROLD
Now there is a matter
of business to attend to.

123
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:32,734
PUSS
The Frog King... is dead.

124
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,888
DONKEY
Put your hat back on, fool.

125
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,614
KING HAROLD
Shrek...

126
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,418
KING HAROLD
...please come hither.

127
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:51,627
SHREK
Yeah, Dad?

128
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:54,927
KING HAROLD
This kingdom needs a new king.

129
00:10:56,268 --> 00:11:00,932
KING HAROLD
You and Fiona
are next in line for the throne.

130
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:06,806
SHREK
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

131
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:10,279
SHREK
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

132
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:17,650
SHREK
Come on, Dad. An ogre as king?

133
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,315
SHREK
That's not such a good idea.

134
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,758
SHREK
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

135
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:29,095
KING HAROLD
Aside from you, there is
only one remaining heir.

136
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:32,432
SHREK
Really? Who is he, Dad?

137
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:34,630
KING HAROLD
His name is...

138
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:37,066
KING HAROLD
...is...

139
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,836
SHREK
What's his name?

140
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:40,570
KING HAROLD
...is...

141
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:43,573
FIONA
Daddy!

142
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,801
KING HAROLD
His name is Arthur.

143
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:04,334
SHREK
Arthur?

144
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:11,871
KING HAROLD
I know you'll do...

145
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,673
KING HAROLD
...what's right.

146
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:19,047
QUEEN
Harold?

147
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,743
SHREK
Dad? Dad!

148
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:23,416
SHREK
Dad?

149
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,615
DONKEY
Do your thing, man.

PRINCE CHARMING
Ah, Mabel!

164
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:59,577
PRINCE CHARMING
Why they call you an ugly stepsister,
I'll never know.

165
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,773
PRINCE CHARMING
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

166
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,682
MABEL
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:11,380
MABEL
What do you want, Charming?

168
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:15,584
PRINCE CHARMING
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

169
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:18,663
PRINCE CHARMING
And a Fuzzy Navel.

00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:21,857
PRINCE CHARMING
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

CAPTAIN HOOKS
We're not your friends.

CAPTAIN HOOK
You don't belong here.

173
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:36,575
PRINCE CHARMING
You're absolutely right,
but, I mean, do any of us?

174
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:38,342
CYCLOPS
Do a number on his face.

175
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:43,080
PRINCE CHARMING
Wait, wait, wait!
We are more alike than you think.

176
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:47,124
PRINCE CHARMING
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs
saved Snow White, and what happened?

177
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,351
EVIL QUEEN
Oh, what's it to you?

178
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:50,758
PRINCE CHARMING
They left you the unfairest of them all.

179
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:55,424
PRINCE CHARMING
Now here you are,
hustling pool to get your next meal.

180
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,398
PRINCE CHARMING
How does that feel?

181
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,467
EVIL QUEEN
pretty unfair.

182
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,009
PRINCE CHARMING
And you!

183
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:10,775
PRINCE CHARMING
Your star puppet abandons the show
to go and find his father.

184
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:14,377
PUPPET MASTER
I hate that little wooden puppet.

185
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,488
PRINCE CHARMING
And Hook.

186

PRINCE CHARMING
Need I say more?

187
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:24,691
PRINCE CHARMING

- Rumpelstiltskin.

188
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,458
PRINCE CHARMING
Where's that firstborn
you were promised?

189
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:33,770
PRINCE CHARMING
Mabel. Remember how you
couldn't get your little fat foot...

190
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,806
PRINCE CHARMING
...into that tiny glass slipper?

191
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:42,004
PRINCE CHARMING
Cinderella is
in Far Far Away right now...

192
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:47,175
PRINCE CHARMING
...eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

193
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,787
PRINCE CHARMING
...that has ever done you wrong!

194
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:54,859
PRINCE CHARMING
Once upon a time, someone decided
that we were the losers.

195
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,860
PRINCE CHARMING
But there are
two sides to every story...

196
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,555
PRINCE CHARMING
...and our side has not been told!

197
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:05,568
PRINCE CHARMING
So who will join me? Who wants
to come out on top for once?

198
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:07,365
PRINCE CHARMING
Who wants their...

199
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:10,669
PRINCE CHARMING
..."happily ever after"?

200
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,521
BLIND MOUSE
This way, gents.

201
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:45,901
PUSS
It's out of my hands, senorita. The
winds of fate have blown on my destiny.

202
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:49,844
PUSS
But I will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

203
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:52,416
PUSS
As are you.

204
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,917
PUSS
And, uh, you.

205
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,216
PUSS
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

206
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:00,722
PUSS
I got to go!

207
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:03,822
DONKEY
I don't wanna leave you either.

208
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:06,795
DONKEY
But you know how Shrek is.
The dude's lost without me.

209
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,066
DONKEY
But don't worry. I'll send you
airmail kisses every day!

210
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:13,769
DONKEY
Be strong, babies.

211

DONKEY
Coco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

212

DONKEY
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

213

DONKEY
That's my special boy!

DONKEY
Come here, all of you!
Give your daddy a big hug!

FIONA
Shrek?

216
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:40,561
FIONA
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

217
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:44,226
SHREK
Come on. There's no way
I could ever run a kingdom.

218
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:47,361
SHREK
That's why your cousin Arthur
is a perfect choice.

219
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:50,031
FIONA
It's not that, no. You see...

220
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:54,635
SHREK
And if he gives me any trouble,
I always have persuasion and reason.

221
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,113
SHREK
Here's persuasion... and here's reason.

SHREK
Fiona...

223

224
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:07,118
SHREK
...and our swamp.

225
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,452
FIONA
It's not going to be just you and me.

I love you too, honey!

235
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:54,002
FIONA
No! I said I'm...

236
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,442
SHREK
You're what?

237
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:01,011
FIONA
I said I'm pregnant!

238
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,650
SHREK
What was that?

239
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:09,845
FIONA
You're going to be a father!

240
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,487
SHREK
That's great!

241

FIONA
Really? I'm glad you think so!

I love you!

Me, too! You!

I'm going to be an uncle!
I'm going to be an uncle!

PUSS
And you, my friend, are royally...

Oh, no.

better out than in, I always say.

No, no, no!

It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

PUSS
...a powerful urge sweeps over him.

263

SHREK
I know how it happened.

264

I just can't believe it.

It's Worcestershire.

Well, my stomach aches and my palms

DONKEY
High school?

296
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:48,716
CHEERLEADERS
Ready? Okay!

297
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,294
CHEERLEADERS
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

298
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:55,388
CHEERLEADERS
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And
dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

299
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:58,001
CHEERLEADERS
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

300
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:07,267
DRIVERS ED INSTRUCTOR
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

301
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:14,312
VAN STUDENT
For lo, bro, don't burn
all my frankincense and myrrh.

302
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:17,944
DONKEY
I'm feeling nauseous from memories
of wedgies and swirlies!

303
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:22,753
PUSS
How did you receive wedgies when you are
clearly not the wearer of the underpants?

304
00:26:22,894 --> 00:26:25,795
DONKEY
Let's just say some things
are better left unsaid.

305
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,991
GUINEVERRE
So I was all like, "I'd rather get
the black plague than go out with you."

306
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:32,467
TIFFANY
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

307
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:35,402
TIFFANY
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

308
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:39,602
GARY
I just altered my character level
to +3 superb-ability.

309
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,304
SHREK
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

310
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:46,975
GARY
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and
summoned the beast and his quadruped?

311
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,314
SHREK
I know you're busy not fiting in, but
can either of you tell me where I can find Arthur?

312
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,755
GARY
He's over there.

313
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:19,349
LANCELOT
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

314
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:24,653
SHREK
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

315
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:28,122
SHREK
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

316
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:30,625
SHREK
Sorry.

317
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:33,990
ARTIE
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

318
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:36,566
PUSS
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

319
00:27:36,701 --> 00:27:38,396
DONKEY
It's top secret!

320
00:27:38,536 --> 00:27:42,131
LANCELOT
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

321
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,269
SHREK
Greetings, Your Majesty.

322
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:47,969
SHREK
This is your lucky day.

323
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:50,906
LANCELOT
What are you supposed to be?

324
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:54,314
LANCELOT
Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun
or something?

325
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,812
SHREK
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

326
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:01,258
LANCELOT
Unhand me, monster!

327
00:28:01,392 --> 00:28:03,360
SHREK
Stop squirming, Arthur.

328
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:05,827
LANCELOT
I'm not Arthur.

329
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:10,357
LANCELOT
I am Lancelot.

330
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:13,164
LANCELOT
That dork over there is Arthur.

331
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:21,439
GUINEVERRE
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

332
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:24,173
GUINEVERRE
...but Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

333
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:27,716
GUINEVERRE
She thought perchance thou would
ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

334
00:28:27,852 --> 00:28:28,944
SHREK
Excuse me?

335
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:33,023
GUINEVERRE
Like, whatever. She's totally into college guys
and mythical creatures.

336
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,554
SHREK
Oh, Arthur...

337
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:42,393
SHREK
...come out, come out, wherever you are!

338
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:47,063
DONKEY
You better run,
you little punk no-goodniks!

339
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:50,606
DONKEY
The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers
are over!

340
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:58,045
HALL MONITOR
Hold it.

341
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:00,775
COSTUME STUDENT
We're here for the mascot contest.

342
00:29:05,456 --> 00:29:08,653
SHREK
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

343
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:11,318
HALL MONITOR
This is a costume?

344
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:13,453
SHREK
Worked on it all night long.

345
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,596
HALL MONITOR
Looks pretty real to me.

346
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:19,134
PUSS
If he were real, could I do this?

347
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:22,466
DONKEY
Or this?

348
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:28,610
SHREK
If it were real, that would have been
agonizingly painful.

349
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,943
DONKEY & SHREK
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

350
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,883
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
Thank you to Professor Primbotom
and his lecture...

351
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,419
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
...on "just say nay".

352
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:42,622
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
And now, without further ado, let's give
a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

353
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,252
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
...to the winner
of our mascot contest, the...

354
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:48,421
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
...ogre?

355
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:52,799
SHREK
That's right. I'm the new mascot.

356
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:56,566
SHREK
So let's really try and beat
the other guys at...

357
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,836
SHREK
...whatever it is they're doing!

358
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:06,373
PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
This is all a bit unorthodox...

359
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:10,180
SHREK
Where can I find Arthur Pendragon?

360
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:13,947
SHREK
Hey, wait...

361
00:30:18,062 --> 00:30:19,689
LANCELOT
Classic.

362
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,526
DONKEY
You should be ashamed of yourself!

363
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,066
LANCELOT
I didn't do it. They did.

364
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:30,602
ARTIE
Please don't eat me.

365
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:33,074
STUDENTS
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

366
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:36,740
SHREK
I'm not here to eat him!

367
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,844
SHREK
Time to pack up
your toothbrush and jammies.

368
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:43,215
SHREK
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

369
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:45,015
ARTIE
What?

370
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:50,755
LANCELOT
Artie a king?
More like the Mayor of Loserville!

371
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,489
LANCELOT
Burn.

372
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:01,230
ARTIE
Is this for real?

373
00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:05,775
SHREK
Absolutely. Clean out your locker, kid.
You got a kingdom to run.

374
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,572
ARTIE
So, wait... l'm really the only heir?

375
00:31:09,914 --> 00:31:11,245
SHREK
The one and only.

376
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,244
ARTIE
Give me... just a second.

377
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:18,248
ARTIE
My good people...

378
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:21,119
ARTIE
...I think there's a lesson here for all of us.

379
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:25,559
ARTIE
Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's
head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think,

380
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,188
ARTIE
"Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.

381
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,299
ARTIE
Maybe I should cut him some slack.

382
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:34,803
ARTIE
'Cause maybe... just maybe...

383
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:38,636
ARTIE
...this guy's gonna turn out to be,
I don't know, a king?

384
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:43,804
ARTIE
And maybe his first royal decree will be to
banish everyone who ever picked on him."

385
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:46,815
ARTIE
That's right, I'm looking at you, jousting team!

386
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:50,348
ARTIE
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

387
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:52,553
ARTIE
I've always loved you.

388
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:56,985
ARTIE
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

389
00:31:57,128 --> 00:32:00,620
ARTIE
...enjoy your stay here in prison
while I rule the free world baby!

390
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:02,357
SHREK
Okay, let's not overdo it.

391
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,833
ARTIE
I'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n' roll!

392
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,835
SHREK
You just overdid it.

393
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,608
SNOW WHITE
Look at you!

394
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,274
SNOW WHITE
You look darling.

395
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:22,613
SLEEPING BEAUTY
Just precious. Look at her.

396
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:25,120
RAPUNZEL
Any cravings since you got pregnant?

397
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,884
FIONA
No. Not at all.

398
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:30,455
FIONA
Do you smell ham?

399
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:33,723
SNOW WHITE
It's present time!

400
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,661
CINDERALLA
Fiona, please open mine first.
It's... It's the one in front.

401
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:44,434
FIONA
"Congratulations on your new
mess mak..." Oh, mess maker!

402
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:47,567
FIONA
"Hopefully this helps.
Love, Cinderella."

403
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:50,574
DORIS
Look at that!

404
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,618
CINDERALLA
It's for the poopies.

405
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:56,310
SLEEPING BEAUTY
Wait... babies poop?

406
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:57,785
RAPUNZEL
Everyone poops, Beauty.

407
00:32:57,922 --> 00:32:59,389
PIG
Fiona!

408
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:02,357
PIG
We all chipped in
for a little present, too.

409
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:04,819
PIG
Ta-da!

410
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,863
GINGERBREAD MAN
You know the baby's gonna love it,
because I do!

411
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,969
FIONA
Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

412
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:13,502
FIONA
Who's this one from?

413
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:16,573
SNOW WHITE
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you most.

414
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:19,767
SNOW WHITE
"Have one on me. Love, Snow White."

415
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:24,240
FIONA
What is it?

416
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:25,906
SNOW WHITE
He's a live-in babysitter.

417
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,142
NANNY DWARF
Where's the baby?

418
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:31,346
FIONA
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

419
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,855
SNOW WHITE
It's nothing. I have six more at home.

420
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,754
NANNY DWARF
- What does he do?
- The cleaning.

421
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:37,485
NANNY DWARF
- The feeding.
- The burping.

422
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:40,096
FIONA
So, what are
Shrek and I supposed to do?

423
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:42,358
RAPUNZEL
Now you have plenty of time
to work on your marriage.

424
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,368
SHREK
Thanks, Rapunzel.
What's that supposed to mean?

425
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:50,531
RAPUNZEL
Come on now, Fiona.
You know what happens.

426
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:53,501
SLEEPING BEAUTY
You're tired all the time.

427
00:33:53,644 --> 00:33:55,373
SNOW WHITE
You start leting yourself go.

428
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,673
GINGERBREAD MAN
Stretch marks.

429
00:33:56,814 --> 00:33:58,145
RAPUNZEL
Say goodbye to romance.

430
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:03,921
FIONA
I'm sorry, but how many
of you have kids?

431
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:05,613
DORIS
She's right!

432
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:10,193
DORIS
A baby will only strengthen the love
Shrek and Fiona have.

433
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:13,161
DORIS
How did Shrek react when you told him?
Tell me!

434
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,495
FIONA
When he first found out, Shrek said...

435
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:34,682
PRINCE CHARMING
Onward, my new friends!
To our happily ever afters!

436
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,519
PRINCE CHARMING
Now... bombs away!

437
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:01,910
CAPTAIN HOOK
Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.

438
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:04,514
MOTHER
- His name's not Peter.
- Shut it, Wendy.

439
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:26,730
PRINCE CHARMING
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

440
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:46,556
GINGERBREAD MAN
You go! Take care of the baby!

441
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:49,854
SNOW WHITE
Everybody stay calm! We're all going to die!

442
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:56,392
FIONA
Everyone in! Now!

443
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,661
PRINCE CHARMING
Come on! Put some back into it!

444
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:03,496
FIONA
We don't have time. Now go!

445
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:05,438
QUEEN
Quickly, ladies!

446
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:09,270
GINGERBREAD MAN
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

447
00:36:24,962 --> 00:36:27,362
PRINCE CHARMING
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

448
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:29,659
GINGERBREAD MAN
The name doesn't ring a bell.

449
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,495
PIG
No bell.

450
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:35,003
PRINCE CHARMING
I suggest you freaks cooperate...

451
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:37,733
PRINCE CHARMING
...with the new King of Far Far Away!

452
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:41,572
GINGERBREAD MAN
The only thing you're ever gonna
be king of is King of the Stupids!

453
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:44,010
PRINCE CHARMING
- Hook!
- Right!

454
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:46,378
CAPTAIN HOOK
Avast, ye cookie.

455
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:50,647
CAPTAIN HOOK
Start talking.

456
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:56,516
MUFFIN MAN & GINGERBREAD MAN
- Gingy!
- Papa!

457
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:58,026
TEACHER
Settle down now.

458
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:15,308
GINGERBREAD MAN
On the good ship Lollipop

459
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:18,882
GINGERBREAD MAN
It's a sweet trip to the candy shop

460
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:20,005
PRINCE CHARMING
You!

461
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,046
PRINCE CHARMING
You can't lie.

462
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:26,850
PRINCE CHARMING
So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek?

463
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,091
PINOCCHIO
Well... I don't know where he's not.

464
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,425
PRINCE CHARMING
You don't know where Shrek is?

465
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:38,160
PINOCCHIO
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

466
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:42,568
PINOCCHIO
...that I couldn't exactly not say that
is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

467
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:44,072
PRINCE CHARMING
So you do know where he is!

468
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,733
PINOCCHIO
On the contrary,
I'm possibly more or less

469
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:49,107
PINOCCHIO
not definitely rejecting the idea

470
00:37:49,246 --> 00:37:52,909
PINOCCHIO
that in no way,
with any amount of uncertainty...

471
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,039
PRINCE CHARMING
Stop it!

472
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:56,312
PINOCCHIO
...I do not know where he shouldn't probably be.

473
00:37:56,454 --> 00:37:58,922
PINOCCHIO
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't.

474
00:37:59,056 --> 00:38:02,651
PINOCCHIO
Even if he wasn't not where
I knew he was, it could mean...

475
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:05,023
GINGERBREAD MAN
On the good ship Lollipop

476
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:09,565
PIG
Enough! Shrek went off
to bring back the next heir!

477
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,367
PRINCE CHARMING
He's bringing back the next heir?

478
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:15,995
PINOCCHIO
No!

479
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:20,438
PRINCE CHARMING
Hook! Get rid of this new "King".

480
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:22,443
PRINCE CHARMING
But bring Shrek to me.

481
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,777
PRINCE CHARMING
I have something special
in mind for him.

482
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:28,077
PINOCCHIO
He'll never fall for your tricks!

483
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:31,415
WOLF
Oh, boy.

484
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:44,291
ARTIE
I can't believe it. Me, a king?

485
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,461
ARTIE
I knew I came from royalty and all, but...

486
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:49,698
ARTIE
...I figured everyone forgot about me.

487
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,571
SHREK
Oh, no. In fact the King
asked for you personally.

488
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:56,271
ARTIE
Really? Wow.

489
00:38:57,615 --> 00:38:59,845
ARTIE
But I know it's not all fun and games.

490
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:02,976
SHREK
It really is
all fun and games, actually.

491
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,715
SHREK
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

492
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:11,191
SHREK
By the way, make sure you hit the boat
just right with the bottle.

493
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:14,126
ARTIE
Any idiot can hit a boat with the bottle.

494
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:17,900
SHREK
Well, I've heard
it's harder than it looks.

495
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:20,003
ARTIE
This is going to be huge.

496
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:25,006
ARTIE
Parties, princesses,
castles. Princesses.

497
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:28,009
DONKEY
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

498
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:30,613
DONKEY
The got the finest chefs
will wait for your order.

499
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:33,717
PUSS
And fortunately,
you'll have the royal food tasters.

500
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:35,546
ARTIE
What do they do?

501
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:40,282
PUSS
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

502
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:43,018
ARTIE & SHREK
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

503
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,687
DONKEY
Don't worry about it. Your bodyguards
will keep you safe.

504
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:49,095
PUSS
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

505
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:52,066
PUSS
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

506
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:53,636
ARTIE
Really?

507
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:56,797
PUSS
The whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance.

508
00:39:57,174 --> 00:39:59,108
DONKEY
Make sure they don't die of famine!

509
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:00,972
PUSS & DONKEY
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

510
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:04,012
PUSS
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

511
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:10,020
SHREK
Festering sores!
You are one funny kity cat.

512
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:12,087
PUSS
What did I say?

513
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:14,589
SHREK
We don't want Artie
geting the wrong idea.

514
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,519
SHREK
Artie?

515
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,561
SHIP CAPTAIN
There goes my hip!

516
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,861
SHREK
Artie! What are you doing?

517
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,931
ARTIE
What does it look like?!

518
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:34,077
SHREK
This really isn't up to you.

519
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:37,078
ARTIE
I don't know anything about being king!

520
00:40:37,214 --> 00:40:39,148
SHREK
You'll learn on the job!

521
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:43,576
ARTIE
Sorry to disapoint you, but I'm going back.

522
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:46,155
SHREK
Back to what? Being a loser?

523
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,285
SHREK
Now look what you did!

524
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:55,896
ARTIE
Look what I did?
Who's holding the wheel, chief?

525
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:58,391
SHREK
Shrek!

526
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:12,739
SHIP CAPTAIN
Land ho!

527
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:27,093
PUSS
How humiliating.

528
00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:31,033
SHREK
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

529
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:34,865
ARTIE
Now it's "Your Highness"?
What happened to "loser"?

530
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:37,906
SHREK
If you think this is geting you
out of anything, well it isn't.

531
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:41,808
SHREK
We're heading back to Far Far Away
one way or another...

532
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:44,380
SHREK
...and you're going to be a father!

533
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:45,948
ARTIE
What?

534
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:48,342
DONKEY
You just said "father".

535
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:51,215
SHREK
King! You're going to be king!

536
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:54,347
ARTIE
"You're going to be king!" Yeah, right.

537
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,992

Where do you think you are going?

538
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:59,595
ARTIE
Far Far Away... from you!

539
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,698
SHREK
You get back here, young man,
and I mean it !

540
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,158
PUSS
Boss? I don't think he's coming back.

541
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:09,500
PUSS
Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

542
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,871
DONKEY
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king?

543
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,843
SHREK
Come on. Why would I do that?

544
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,040
SHREK
Besides, he'll be ten times
better at it than me.

545
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:23,142
DONKEY
Then you're gonna change your tactics
if you want to get anywhere with him.

546
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:27,320
SHREK
You're right, Donkey.

547
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,184
SHREK
What about this?

548
00:42:31,328 --> 00:42:35,162
SHREK & DONKEY
- Shrek!
- Come on. It's just a joke.

549
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,065
SHREK
Still...

550
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:56,513
SHREK
Listen, Artie.

551
00:42:57,087 --> 00:43:02,218
SHREK
If you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

552
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:06,489
SHREK
I'm not trying to get up in your grill
or raise your roof, or whatever.

553
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,757
SHREK
But what I am screamin' is, yo...

554
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:12,096
SHREK
...check out this
kazing thazing, bazaby!

555
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,329
SHREK
If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying

556
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:17,406
SHEK
ain't straight trippin',
say, "Oh, no, you didn't!

557
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,975
SHREK
You're getting on my last nerve."

558
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,102
SHREK
And then I'll know it's...
I'll know it's wack!

559
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:25,909
ARTIE
Somebody, help!

560
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,451
ARTIE
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

561
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:33,215
SHREK & ARTIE
- Artie, wait.
- Come on! Help! Hello?

562
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:38,422
MERLIN
Greetings, cosmic children
of the universe.

563
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:40,496
MERLIN
Welcome to my serenity circle.

564
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:44,761
MERLIN
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

565
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:46,733
MERLIN
Now prepare to...

566
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:55,242
MERLIN
I knew I should have got that warranty!

567
00:43:58,148 --> 00:43:59,615
ARTIE
Mr. Merlin?

568
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,217
SHREK
You know this guy?

569
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:05,617
ARTIE
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

570
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:09,123
MERLIN
Technically, I was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue.

571
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:11,352
MERLIN
At the request of my therapist,

572
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:15,124
MERLIN
and the school authorities, I retired
to the tranquility of nature

573
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:17,426
MERLIN
to discover my divine purpose.

574
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:22,337
MERLIN
Now, can I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

575
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:23,565
SHREK
Uh, no.

576
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:27,040
MERLIN
Sure you don't want to try
my famous Rock Au Gratin?

577
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:31,414
MERLIN
It's organic.

578
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:33,982
SHREK
Thanks. I just ate a boulder on the way in.

579
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:37,053
SHREK
What we need, are directions
back back to Far Far Away.

580
00:44:37,187 --> 00:44:39,712
ARTIE
"We"? Who said I was going with you?

581
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:44,226
SHREK
I did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

582
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:46,420
ARTIE
If it's such a great job, you do it.

583
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:51,230
SHREK
Understand this, kid. It's no more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

584
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:53,666
ARTIE
So, that was your Mr. Nice Guy?

585
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:55,738
SHREK
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

586
00:44:55,873 --> 00:45:00,276
ARTIE
You know what ?
Why don't you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone!

587
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,938
SHREK
Was that a crack about ogres? You get
your royal highness to Far Far Away...

588
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:09,109
SHREK
...before I kick it there!
Now, which way am I kicking?

589
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:11,084
MERLIN
I could have tell you, but since you're

590
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:13,746
MERLIN
in the midst
of a self-destructive rage spiral,

591
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:16,416
MERLIN
it would be karmically irresponsible.

592
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,223
SHREK
Self-destructive?
Look, are you going to help us or not?

593
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:22,958
MERLIN
Most definitely, but only after you

594
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,297
MERLIN
take the journey to your soul!

595
00:45:26,436 --> 00:45:27,801
SHREK
Yeah, I don't think so.

596
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:31,772
MERLIN
It's either that
or some primal scream therapy.

597
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:36,506
SHREK
All right, all right.
Journey to the soul.

598
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:39,212
MERLIN
Now, all of you,

599
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:41,874
MERLIN
look into the Fire of Truth

600
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:45,011
MERLIN
and tell me what you see.

601
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:49,723
DONKEY
Ooh, charades!

602
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,627
DONKEY
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

603
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:57,359
MERLIN
Okay, monster... go for it.

604
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:07,738
SHREK
I see a rainbow pony.

605
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:09,812
MERLIN
Excellent work! Now the boy.

606
00:46:09,947 --> 00:46:11,414
ARTIE
This is lame.

607
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:13,812
MERLIN
You're lame! Now just go for it.

608
00:46:15,385 --> 00:46:16,716
ARTIE
Okay.

609
00:46:17,554 --> 00:46:21,991
ARTIE
There's a baby bird and a father bird
siting in a nest.

610
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,116
MERLIN
Yes! Stay with it!

611
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:28,955
ARTIE
The dad just flew away. Why did
he leave the little bird all alone?

612
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:33,069
ARTIE
It's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

613
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:36,132
ARTIE
It's going to fall!

614
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:44,971
MERLIN
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

615
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:53,312
ARTIE
Okay, I get it. The bird's me.
My dad left. So what?

616
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:07,997
SHREK
Look, Artie, um...

617
00:47:12,342 --> 00:47:15,106
SHREK
Just thought I'd help set the mood...

618
00:47:15,245 --> 00:47:18,578
SHREK
...for your big heart-to-heart chat.

619
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:30,357
SHREK
I know what it's like
to not feel ready for something.

620
00:47:32,696 --> 00:47:35,028
SHREK
Even ogres get scared.

621
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:38,699
SHREK
You know... once in a while.

622
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:44,470
ARTIE
I know you want me
to be king, but I can't.

623
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:47,475
ARTIE
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be, all right?

624
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:50,869
ARTIE
Even my own dad knew
I wasn't worth the trouble.

625
00:47:51,014 --> 00:47:54,211
ARTIE
He dumped me at that school
the first chance he got...

626
00:47:54,885 --> 00:47:57,217
ARTIE
...and I never heard from him again.

627
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:02,723
SHREK
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

628
00:48:03,226 --> 00:48:05,387
ARTIE
Well, I doubt he was worse than mine.

629
00:48:06,229 --> 00:48:07,526
SHREK
Oh, yeah?

630
00:48:07,664 --> 00:48:11,725
SHREK
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

631
00:48:12,569 --> 00:48:14,764
SHREK
Now I guess I should have seen it coming.

632
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:19,171
SHREK
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

633
00:48:21,078 --> 00:48:23,569
ARTIE
Okay, I guess that's pretty bad.

634
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,111
SHREK
you know, it may be hard to believe,

635
00:48:28,251 --> 00:48:31,709
SHREK
what, with my obvious charm
and good looks,

636
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:34,790
SHREK
but people used
to think I was a monster.

637
00:48:34,925 --> 00:48:38,588
SHREK
And for a long time, I believed them.

638
00:48:40,597 --> 00:48:42,189
SHREK
But after a while,

639
00:48:42,332 --> 00:48:45,859
SHREK
you learn to ignore
the names people call you

640
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:48,335
SHREK
and you just trust who you are.

641
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,603
ARTIE
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

642
00:48:54,444 --> 00:48:58,005
ARTIE
You just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap.

643
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:00,976
SHREK
Thanks, Artie.

644
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:04,781
ARTIE
The soap's because
you stink... really bad.

645
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:08,447
SHREK
Yeah... I got that.

646
00:49:12,462 --> 00:49:15,329
CINDERELLA
This place is filthy!

647
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:17,224
CINDERELLA
I feel like a hobo.

648
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:21,232
SNOW WHITE
I'm sorry, but this
isn't just working for me.

649
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:25,933
SLEEPING BEAUTY
Everything's always about you, isn't it.
Something in your attitude is not helping.

650
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:29,773
SNOW WHITE
Maybe it just bothers you
I was voted fairest in the land.

651
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:32,006
RAPUNZEL
Oh you mean in that rigged election?

652
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:35,118
SNOW WHITE
Oh give me a break. "Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

653
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:38,380
SNOW WHITE
...let down thy golden extensions!"

654
00:49:38,522 --> 00:49:43,323
QUEEN
Ladies, let go of your pety complaints
and let's work together!

655
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:49,288
SNOW WHITE
So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

656
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:51,526
SNOW WHITE
in this stinkhole until we rot.

657
00:49:51,668 --> 00:49:55,195
FIONA
No, we get inside and find out
what Charming's up to.

658
00:49:55,338 --> 00:49:58,034
DORIS
I know he's a jerk and everything,

659
00:49:58,175 --> 00:50:02,339
DORIS
but that Charming
makes me hotter than July.

660
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,011
FIONA
That's it!

661
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:35,409
RAPUNZEL
Come on! This way!

662
00:50:35,545 --> 00:50:36,534
FIONA
Rapunzel, wait!

663
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:47,887
FIONA
Charming, let go of her.

664
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:50,652
PRINCE CHARMING
But why would I want to do that?

665
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:57,188
FIONA
What?

666
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:02,431
PRINCE CHARMING
Say hello, ladies,
to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

667
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,240
FIONA
Rapunzel, how could you?

668
00:51:08,378 --> 00:51:10,642
RAPUNZEL
Jealous much?

669
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,214
PRINCE CHARMING
Soon you'll be back
where you started,

670
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,978
PRINCE CHARMING
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers.

671
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:19,748
PRINCE CHARMING
That is, if I let you last the week.

672
00:51:22,058 --> 00:51:24,652
RAPUNZEL
But Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

673
00:51:24,794 --> 00:51:28,787
PRINCE CHARMING
Not here, kitten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

674
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:32,058
PRINCE CHARMING
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

675
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:35,467
FIONA
Shrek will be back soon, Charming
and you'll be sorry.

676
00:51:35,605 --> 00:51:37,004
PRINCE CHARMING
Sorry?!

677
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,406
PRINCE CHARMING
Don't you realize once Shrek
sets foot in Far Far Away...

678
00:51:41,545 --> 00:51:43,308
PRINCE CHARMING
...he's doomed?

679
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,479
DONKEY
Look out! They got a piano!

680
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:27,988
CAPTAIN HOOK
Kill them all... except the fat one.

681
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:32,493
CAPTAIN HOOK
King Charming has something special
in mind for you, ogre.

682
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:33,926
SHREK
King Charming?

683
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:35,088
CAPTAIN HOOK
Attack!

684
00:52:41,371 --> 00:52:42,531
SHREK
Artie, duck!

685
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:58,349
CAPTAIN HOOK
Ready the plank!

686
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,731
DONKEY & ARTIE
- Shrek!
- Help!

687
00:53:35,058 --> 00:53:36,355
CAPTAIN HOOK
Cowards!

688
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:38,859
SHREK
What has Charming done with Fiona?

689
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:41,589
CAPTAIN HOOK
She's gonna get what's coming to her.

690
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:47,068
CAPTAIN HOOK
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

691
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:49,728
PUSS & DONKEY
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

692
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:52,972
SHREK
Get yourself back
to Worcestershire, kid.

693
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:56,601
ARTIE
No, Shrek. Hold on a second.
I've got an idea.

694
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:59,010
MERLIN
I am a buzzing bee.

695
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:02,880
ARTIE
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them...

696
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:06,045
ARTIE
...I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

697
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:09,625
MERLIN
Forget it. I don't have that kind
of magic in me anymore, kid.

698
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:13,456
MERLIN
How about a hug?
That's the best kind of magic.

699
00:54:13,596 --> 00:54:15,962
ARTIE
Mr merlin, please. I know you can do it.

700
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:17,896
MERLIN
I said forget it!

701
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:19,365
ARTIE
But...

702
00:54:26,776 --> 00:54:28,368
MERLIN
What's with you?

703
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:32,876
ARTIE
It's just so hard, you know?

704
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,680
ARTIE
They really need to get back,
'cause their kingdom's in trouble.

705
00:54:37,821 --> 00:54:40,346
ARTIE
'Cause there's a really bad man.

706
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,253
ARTIE
And it's just so hard!

707
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:44,519
MERLIN
Take it easy.

708
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:48,028
ARTIE
No! I don't think you understand!

709
00:54:48,164 --> 00:54:52,692
ARTIE
There's a mean person doing
mean things to good people.

710
00:54:52,836 --> 00:54:54,531
SHREK
Have a heart, old man.

711
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:58,835
ARTIE
They really need your help to get them back.
So why won't you help them?!

712
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,271
MERLIN
Okay.

713
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:06,405
MERLIN
I'll go get my things.

714
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:10,379
ARTIE
Piece of cake.

715
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,047
SHREK
Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?

716
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,887
MERLIN
I am a little rusty, so there
could be some side effects.

717
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:19,494
DONKEY & MERLIN
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

718
00:55:19,629 --> 00:55:23,395
MERLIN
Whatever it is, no matter
how excruciatingly painful it may be,

719
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:26,696
MERLIN
it will wear off eventually. I think.

720
00:55:28,671 --> 00:55:30,901
MERLIN & DONKEY
- Oops.
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

721
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,170
SHREK
Look, if Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

722
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:37,176
SHREK
Even if his robe doesn't quite cover...

723
00:55:37,313 --> 00:55:39,838
MERLIN
Alacritious... Expeditious...

724
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:42,679
MERLIN
...a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!

725
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:45,652
MERLIN
Let's help our friends get back...

726
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:49,722
MERLIN
...soon!

727
00:55:57,066 --> 00:55:58,658
MERLIN
It worked!

728
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:10,403
DONKEY
I haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

729
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:12,109
SHREK
Donkey?

730
00:56:12,248 --> 00:56:15,081
DONKEY
What? Is something in my teeth?

731
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,514
DONKEY
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

732
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:28,922
PUSS
At least you don't look
like some kind of bloated roasted pinata!

733
00:56:29,065 --> 00:56:31,124
PUSS
You should think about going on a diet!

734
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:35,863
DONKEY
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
I feel all exposed and nasty!

735
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,872
DONKEY
So you two think this is funny?

736
00:56:42,378 --> 00:56:44,175
ARTIE
I'm really sorry, guys.

737
00:56:44,314 --> 00:56:46,782
SHREK
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

738
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:54,582
DONKEY
How in the Hans Christian Andersen

739
00:56:54,724 --> 00:56:57,488
DONKEY
am I supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

740
00:56:57,627 --> 00:57:00,460
PUSS
Hey, hey, hey!
Be very careful with those.

741
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:05,231
PUSS
They were made in Madrid
by the finest...

742
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:07,893
DONKEY
You'll learn to control that.

743
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:15,801
DONKEY
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort
inserts or arch supports or something.

744
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:26,854
EVIL DWARF
Watch it. I'm walking here
and I'm gonna keep going until...

745
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,082
SHREK
Pinocchio!

746
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:30,850
PINOCCHIO
Shrek! Help me!

747
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:34,191
SHREK & PINOCCHIO
- What happened?
- Charming and the villains
have taken over everything!

748
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:38,096
PINOCCHIO
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
And now she's...

749
00:57:38,234 --> 00:57:39,758
SHREK
She's what?! What?!

750
00:57:42,105 --> 00:57:43,936
SHREK
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

751
00:57:44,073 --> 00:57:46,303
DONKEY
You heard him. Help the brother out.

752
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:48,535
PUSS
Do you see any pockets on me?

753
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:50,509
DONKEY
Hold on a second.

754
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:57,180
PUSS
I had no idea, really. I... I swear.

755
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:00,549
SHREK
Quick Pinocchio! Where is Fiona?

756
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,456
PINOCCHIO
Charming has her locked away
someplace. You have to find him!

757
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:07,461
PINOCCHIO
He's probably getting ready
for the show!

758
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:09,929
SHREK
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

759
00:58:14,938 --> 00:58:17,338
PINOCCHIO
"It's a Happily Ever After After All".

760
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:19,805
SHREK
"Shrek's final performance"?

761
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:24,073
DONKEY
Wow, Shrek! You didn't tell us
you were in a play!

762
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:27,671
SHREK
Well I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

763
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:29,375
GUARD
It's the ogre! Get him!

764
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,052
PUSS
Don't worry, jefe. I got this.

765
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:41,223
GUARD
Uck! Kill it!

766
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:47,362
ARTIE
Look. Don't you know who
he thinks he is? How dare you!

767
00:58:47,503 --> 00:58:49,027
SHREK
Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs.

768
00:58:49,172 --> 00:58:54,109
ARTIE
He's a star, people! Hello?
I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

769
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:55,767
SHREK
I'm going to lose it!

770
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:59,712
ARTIE
I assume everything is ready for tonight?
You did get the list for the dressing room?

771
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:02,943
DONKEY
yeah, the breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

772
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:06,385
DONKEY
And I hope you have the saffron corn
with jalapeno honey buter.

773
00:59:06,522 --> 00:59:09,514
DONKEY
Our client cannot get
into his proper emotional state

774
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:11,456
DONKEY
without jalapeno honey buter!

775
00:59:11,594 --> 00:59:12,993
SHREK
I just lost it.

776
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:16,288
GUARD
maybe they should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

777
00:59:16,432 --> 00:59:19,924
PUSS
Oh, we will have much to say
to Nancy, I promise!

778
00:59:21,604 --> 00:59:25,301
PRINCE CHARMING
"With this sword, I do..." No. "With..."

779
00:59:25,441 --> 00:59:29,104
PRINCE CHARMING
"With this sword, I do smote thee!"

780
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:32,481
PRINCE CHARMING
Is "smote" the right word? "Smoot"?

781
00:59:32,615 --> 00:59:34,480
PRINCE CHARMING
I don't think that's a word, actually.

782
00:59:34,617 --> 00:59:38,951
PRINCE CHARMING
Maybe I should just "smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

783
00:59:40,123 --> 00:59:43,286
PRINCE CHARMING
Shrek attacks me.
I pretend to be afraid.

784
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:48,430
PRINCE CHARMING
"Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

785
00:59:48,564 --> 00:59:52,227
PRINCE CHARMING
Blah, blah, blah. Oh,
it just doesn't feel real enough yet!

786
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:56,162
PRINCE CHARMING
Who told you to stop dancing?!

787
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:57,772
CYCLOPS
Wink and turn.

788
00:59:57,907 --> 01:00:01,138
PRINCE CHARMING
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

789
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:13,016
PRINCE CHARMING
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mummy.

790
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:15,351
PRINCE CHARMING
And I assure you...

791
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:20,485
PRINCE CHARMING
...the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second...

792
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:23,325
PRINCE CHARMING
...we've had to wait.

793
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:26,367
SHREK
Break a leg.

794
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:29,266
SHREK
On second thought,
let me break it for you.

795
01:00:29,405 --> 01:00:33,705
PRINCE CHARMING
Thank goodness, you're here. I was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

796
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:35,470
SHREK
Where's Fiona?

797
01:00:35,611 --> 01:00:39,843
PRINCE CHARMING
Don't worry. She and the others
are safe... for now.

798
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:52,358
PRINCE CHARMING
Let me guess. Arthur.

799
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:55,054
ARTIE
It's Artie, actually.

800
01:00:55,198 --> 01:01:00,192
PRINCE CHARMING
This boy is supposed to be
the new King of Far Far Away?

801
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,402
PRINCE CHARMING
How pathetic.

802
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:06,406
PRINCE CHARMING
Now, stand still, so I won't make a mess.

803
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:09,978
SHREK
Charming, stop! I'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

804
01:01:10,113 --> 01:01:11,774
SHREK
This isn't about him.

805
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:16,882
ARTIE
Then who's it about?
I'm supposed to be king, right?

806
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:22,590
SHREK
You weren't really next in line
for the throne, okay.

807
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:24,124
SHREK
I was.

808
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,593
ARTIE
But you said the King
asked for me personally.

809
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,561
SHREK
Not exactly.

810
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:31,132
ARTIE
What that supposed to mean?

811
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:33,758
SHREK
I said whatever I had to say, all right?

812
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:37,600
SHREK
I wasn't right for the job,
I just needed some fool to replace me.

813
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,403
SHREK
And you fit the bill. So... So just go!

814
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,539
ARTIE
You were playing me the whole time.

815
01:01:46,682 --> 01:01:48,445
SHREK
You catch on real fast, kid.

816
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:51,678
SHREK
Maybe you're not
as big of a loser as I thought.

817
01:01:58,094 --> 01:02:00,460
ARTIE
You know, for a minute there...

818
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:02,496
ARTIE & PRINCE CHARMING
...I actually thought...
- What?

819
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:06,124
PRINCE CHARMING
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

820
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:08,100
PRINCE CHARING
What did you expect?

821
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,107
PRINCE CHARMING
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

Had we stayed put like I suggested,

838
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:32,884
SNOW WHITE
we could be sipping tea
out of little heart-shaped cups.

839
01:03:33,022 --> 01:03:34,546
CINDERELLA
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

840
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,318
SNOW WHITE
And eating crumpets
smothered with loganberries.

841
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,052
CINDERELLA
Yeah, loganberries.

842
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:41,060
SNOW WHITE & CINDERELLA
- Shut up, Cindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

843
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:44,064
CINDERELLA
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

844
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,998
SNOW WHITE
Who cares who's "running the kingdom" anyway?

845
01:03:47,136 --> 01:03:50,367
FIONA & QUEEN
- I care.
- And you should all care too.

846
01:03:54,343 --> 01:03:57,244
DONKEY
I have your badge number, tin can!

847
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,245
DONKEY & FIONA
- Donkey?
- Princess!

848
01:03:59,382 --> 01:04:00,371
FIONA
Puss?

849
01:04:00,516 --> 01:04:04,577
PUSS
I am Puss, stuck here
inside this hideous body.

850
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,744
DONKEY
And I'm me!

851
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,014
FIONA
But you're...

852
01:04:07,156 --> 01:04:09,818
DONKEY
I know, I know, everything's fruity in the loops,
but what happened is

853
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:11,927
DONKEY
we went to high school,
and the boat crashed

854
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:14,621
DONKEY
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

855
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:16,959
DORIS
You poor sweet things.

856

CINDERELLA
I don't get it.

857
01:04:18,634 --> 01:04:22,365
SNOW WHITE
The cat turned into a little horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

858
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:23,870
SLEEPING BEAUTY
Who dat?

859
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:25,030
FIONA
Where's Shrek?

860
01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:29,167
DONKEY
Charming has him. He plans to kill Shrek
tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

861
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:34,743
FIONA
All right, everyone.
We need to find a way out now.

01:04:34,884 --> 01:04:38,411
SNOW WHITE
You're right.
Ladies, assume the position!

863
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:44,486
FIONA
What are you doing?

864
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:46,626
SLEEPING BEAUTY
Waiting to be rescued.

865
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,730
FIONA
You've got to be kidding me.

866
01:04:48,864 --> 01:04:51,628
SNOW WHITE
What do you expect us to do? We're just four...

867
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:55,066
SNOW WHITE
...I mean three, super-hot princesses...

868
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:59,265
SNOW WHITE
...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre
and an old lady!

869
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:04,443
QUEEN
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

870
01:05:13,055 --> 01:05:14,852
FIONA
Mom!

871
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:19,257
QUEEN
You didn't actually think you got your fighting
skills from your father, did you?

872
01:05:19,395 --> 01:05:22,125
SNOW WHITE
Excuse me. I think there's still one more.

873
01:05:32,308 --> 01:05:34,640
FIONA
Why don't you just lie down?

874
01:05:37,313 --> 01:05:40,180
FIONA
Okay, girls, from here on out...

875
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:42,784
FIONA
...we're gonna take care of business ourselves.

876
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:04,363
ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Far Far Away Theatre at the
Charming Pavilion is proud to present...

877
01:06:04,507 --> 01:06:06,270
ANNOUNCER
..."It's A Happily Ever After
After AII."

878
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:09,708
EVIL KNIGHT
Enjoy your evening
of theatrical reverie, citizen.

879
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:13,178
EVIL KNIGHT
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

880
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,394
PRINCE CHARMING
Places, everyone!

881
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:34,662
SHREK
Easy!

882
01:06:34,804 --> 01:06:38,706
CYCLOPS
Sorry. I guess I was showing off
for the little one.

883
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:43,037
CYCLOPS
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Come here, beautiful.

884
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:49,207
SHREK
Well, she's got your eye.

885
01:06:50,453 --> 01:06:55,390
CYCLOPS
Who would have thought a monster like
me deserved something as special as you?

886
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:40,092
SNOW WHITE
~ Little birdies, take wing ~

887
01:07:40,936 --> 01:07:43,564
SNOW WHITE
~ Flitting down from the trees they appear ~

888
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:46,174
SNOW WHITE
~ And to chirp in my ear ~

889
01:07:47,443 --> 01:07:50,435
SNOW WHITE
~ All because I sing ~

890
01:08:20,075 --> 01:08:21,133
FIONA
Move it! Go!

891
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,479
DONKEY
My babies!

892
01:08:30,486 --> 01:08:31,475
PUSS
Help!

893
01:09:17,032 --> 01:09:19,023
DORIS
Hey, how's it goin'?

894
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:31,646
PUSS
O to the K. The coast is clear.

895
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:34,408
DONKEY
All right people, let's do this thing.
Go, Team Dynamite!

896
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:38,384
PINOCCHIO
I thought we agreed go by the name
Team Super Cool.

897
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,750
GINGERBREAD MAN
I recall it was Team Awesome.

898
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:42,823
WOLF
I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

899
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:44,926
DONKEY
All right, all right, all right!
From henceforth,

900
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,190
DONKEY
We will be known as Team Alpha Super Awesome
Cool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

901
01:09:49,331 --> 01:09:53,563
PIG
Ach de liebe! There is some strange
little girl over there staring at us!

902
01:09:54,503 --> 01:09:55,868
DONKEY
Artie!

903
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,370
PUSS
Wait, wait!

904
01:09:57,506 --> 01:09:59,701
PUSS
Where is the fire, senor?

905
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:01,867
ARTIE
Please. Don't act so innocent.

906
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:05,777
ARTIE
You both knew what was going on
and kept it to yourselves.

907
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:07,506
DONKEY
Artie, it's not like it seems.

908
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,483
ARTIE
It's not? I think it seems pretty clear.

909
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:13,144
ARTIE
He was using me. That's all.

910
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:15,723
DONKEY
Using you? You really don't get it.

911
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:18,850
PUSS
Shrek only said
those things to protect you.

912
01:10:19,528 --> 01:10:24,192
DONKEY
Charming was going to kill you, Artie!
Shrek saved your life.

913
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:36,369
RUMPLESTILTSKIN
Cue the spot!

914
01:10:40,215 --> 01:10:42,740
RAPUNZEL
~ I wait alone up here ~

915
01:10:42,885 --> 01:10:45,581
RAPUNZEL
~ I'm trapped another day ~

916
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:48,918
RAPUNZEL
~ Locked up here, please set me free ~

917
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:52,084
RAPUNZEL
~ My new life I almost see ~

918
01:10:52,227 --> 01:10:54,923
RAPUNZEL
~ A castle, you and me ~

919
01:10:55,064 --> 01:11:00,161
RAPUNZEL
~ Yes, a castle, you and me ~

920
01:11:02,237 --> 01:11:03,295
RUMPLESTILTSKIN
Cherubs!

921
01:11:07,242 --> 01:11:11,042
PRINCE CHARMING
~ Tis I, Tis I
Upon my regal steed ~

922
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,807
PRINCE CHARMING
~ Princess, my love ~

923
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:15,712
PRINCE CHARMING
~ At last you shall be freed
I'm strong ~

924
01:11:15,851 --> 01:11:17,819
PRINCE CHARMING
~ And brave
And dashing my way there ~

925
01:11:18,253 --> 01:11:23,919
PRINCE CHARMING
~ With speed! With might!
With soft and bouncy hair! ~

926
01:11:24,893 --> 01:11:28,659
PRINCE CHARMING
~ - Through the blistering desert
- Hot! ~

927
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:31,823
PRINCE CHARMING
~ - Across the stormiest sea
- Wet! ~

928
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:33,958
PRINCE CHARMING
~ Facing creatures so vile ~

929
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:35,229
PRINCE CHARMING
~ Foul! ~

930
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:39,501
PRINCE CHARMING
~ So you can gaze upon me! ~

931
01:11:40,809 --> 01:11:43,141
RAPUNZEL
~ I knew you'd come for me ~

932
01:11:43,278 --> 01:11:47,112
RAPUNZEL
~ And now we finally meet ~

933
01:11:47,249 --> 01:11:48,716
PRINCE CHARMING
~ I knew you'd wait ~

934
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:53,379
PRINCE CHARMING
~ And from my plate of love you'd eat ~

935
01:12:13,308 --> 01:12:16,641
PRINCE CHARMING
~ Who is this terribly ugly fiend
Who so rudely intervened? ~

936
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:18,610
PRINCE CHARMING
~ Will Charming fight or flee? ~

937
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:19,805
PRINCE CHARMING
~ Oh please rescue me! ~

938
01:12:19,948 --> 01:12:21,643
PRINCE CHARMING
~ From this monstrosity! ~

939
01:12:21,784 --> 01:12:26,812
PRINCE CHARMING
~ Fear thee not, honey lamb!
I will slice this thing up like a ham! ~

940
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,457
SHREK
Oh, boy.

941
01:12:29,591 --> 01:12:33,186
PRINCE CHARMING
~ You are about to enter a world of pain ~

942
01:12:33,328 --> 01:12:37,662
PRINCE CHARMING
~ With which you are not familiar! ~

943
01:12:41,103 --> 01:12:45,506
SHREK
Well, it can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance you're giving.

944
01:12:49,178 --> 01:12:51,169
RUMPLESTILTSKIN
"Prepare, foul beast."

945
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:56,547
PRINCE CHARMING
~ Prepare, foul beast, your time is done! ~

946
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:59,848
SHREK
Could you kill me and then sing?

947
01:13:01,356 --> 01:13:03,051
PRINCE CHARMING
Be quiet!

948
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:07,322
SHREK
Come on, I'm just having fun with you.
That's actually a very nice leotard.

949
01:13:07,463 --> 01:13:08,725
PRINCE CHARMING
Thank you.

950
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:10,957
SHREK
Do they come in men's sizes?

951
01:13:14,036 --> 01:13:15,765
CAPTAIN HOOK
Now that be funny!

952
01:13:15,904 --> 01:13:17,872
PRINCE CHARMING
Enough!

953
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:24,075
PRINCE CHARMING
Now you'll finally
know what it's like...

954
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:27,740
PRINCE CHARMING
...to have everything you worked for...

955
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:31,910
PRINCE CHARMING
...everything that's precious to you,
taken away.

956
01:13:32,054 --> 01:13:35,387
PRINCE CHARMING
Now you'll know how I felt.

957
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:44,392
PIG
Sausage roll!

958
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:04,275
PUSS
Pray for mercy from Puss!

959
01:14:04,419 --> 01:14:05,909
DONKEY
And Donkey!

960
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:07,179
DONKEY
D

961
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,462
SHREK
Hi, honey.

962
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:22,627
FIONA
Sorry we're late. You okay?

963
01:14:22,771 --> 01:14:25,103
SHREK
Much better, now that you're here.

964
01:14:27,776 --> 01:14:32,975
SHREK
So, Charming, you want to let me out of
these so we can settle this ogre-to-man?

965
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:37,449
PRINCE CHARMING
Ooh, that sounds fun.
But I have a better idea.

966
01:14:53,302 --> 01:14:55,702
SHREK & FIONA
- Fiona!
- No! Let go of me!

967
01:14:55,837 --> 01:14:59,967
PRINCE CHARMING
You will not ruin things
this time, ogre. Kill it.

968
01:15:03,812 --> 01:15:05,575
ARTIE
Everybody, stop!

969
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:09,509
PRINCE CHARMING
Oh, what is it now?!

970
01:15:09,651 --> 01:15:10,913
SHREK
Artie?

971
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:23,064
ARTIE
Who really thinks we need
to settle things this way?

972
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:31,033
ARTIE
You're telling me you want to be villains
your whole lives?

973
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:34,973
CAPTAIN HOOK
But we are villains!
It's the only thing we know.

974
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:37,544
ARTIE
Did you never wish
you could be something else?

975
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,137
EVIL TREE
It's easy for you to say. You're not
some evil enchanted tree.

976
01:15:41,283 --> 01:15:44,047
PRINCE CHARMING
You morons! Don't listen to him! Attack!

977
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:46,984
EVIL TREE
What Steve's trying too say is
it's hard to come by honest work

978
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:49,147
EVIL TREE
when the whole world's against you.

979
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,020
EVIL TREE
Right. Thanks, Ed.

980
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:55,562
ARTIE
Okay, fair enough. You're right.
I'm not a talking tree.

981
01:15:55,697 --> 01:15:56,789
ARTIE
But you know...

982
01:15:56,932 --> 01:16:00,060
ARTIE
...a good friend of mine once told me...

983
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:05,230
ARTIE
...that just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

984
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:07,365
ARTIE
...or just some loser...

985
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:10,777
ARTIE
...doesn't mean you are one.

986
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:17,517
ARTIE
The thing that matters most
is what you think of yourself.

987
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:21,953
ARTIE
If there's something you really want,
or someone you really want to be...

988
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:25,719
ARTIE
...then the only person standing
in your way is you.

989
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:27,991
RUMPLESTILTSKIN
- Me?
- Get him!

990
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,529
ARTIE
No, no, no!

991
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:32,600
ARTIE
What I mean is each of you...

992
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:34,998
ARTIE
...is standing in your own way.

993
01:16:38,907 --> 01:16:41,398
HEADLESS HORSEMAN
I always wanted to play the flute.

994
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:45,206
EVIL QUEEN
I'd like to open up a spa... in France!

995
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:49,909
CAPTAIN HOOK
I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

996
01:17:38,633 --> 01:17:41,796
PRINCE CHARMING
A new era finally begins!

997
01:17:43,638 --> 01:17:45,299
PRINCE CHARMING
Now all of you...

998
01:17:46,141 --> 01:17:48,541
PRINCE CHARMING
...bow before your King!

999
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:57,315
SHREK
You need to work on your aim.

1000
01:17:59,654 --> 01:18:02,521
PRINCE CHARMING
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

1001
01:18:02,657 --> 01:18:05,148
SHREK
Now I guess you need to keep looking...

1002
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:09,221
SHREK
...because I'm not giving up mine.

1003
01:18:14,503 --> 01:18:15,663
PRINCE CHARMING
Mommy?

1004
01:18:27,015 --> 01:18:29,176
SHREK

Okay, Senor Hocusy-Pocusy, the time

Although I have been enjoying

Please say you didn't.

MERLIN
All right, all right! Look.

1013
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:22,266
MERLIN
You're gonna feel a little pinch and possibly
lower intestinal discomfort...

1014
01:19:22,404 --> 01:19:24,736
MERLIN
...but this should do the trick.

MERLIN
Oops.

1018
01:19:38,587 --> 01:19:39,986

Ah, never mind.

What did I tell you?
I think the kid's going to be a great king.

FIONA
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

1021
01:19:53,268 --> 01:19:56,260

I have something
much more important in mind.
